Abstract = {The contamination of an estuary with heavy metals by a single large ore
   processing plant provided a unique opportunity to assess the use of
   mussels and oysters as indicators of heavy metal contamination. Field
   accumulation and depuration experiments, variation of metal content with
   size and prediction of water movements are described from shellfish
   surveys covering the Derwent River and adjacent coastal waters. Oysters
   were found to be suitable for monitoring zinc, cadmium, lead and copper
   contamination. Mussels were also suitable for monitoring zinc, cadmium
   and lead, but in this instance were found unsuitable for monitoring
   copper as the surveys indicate that copper accumulation is suppressed in
   mussels in a contaminated environment. The rate of accumulation and
   depuration of metals by oysters and mussels in field trials has been
   related to the anatomy of the animals and the sequestering of some
   metals in granulocytes. Uneven metal distribution between gonad and
   other tissues has been found to cause seasonal variation of heavy metals
   in oysters.},

Title = {Oyster arsenic, cadmium, copper, mercury, lead and zinc levels in the
   northern South China Sea: long-term spatiotemporal distributions,
   combined effects, and risk assessment to human health},

Abstract = {Estuarine and coastal ecosystems are often considered vulnerable due to
   the complex biogeochemical processes and the human disturbances through
   a variety of pollution. Among environmental contaminants, heavy metals
   in estuarine and coastal ecosystems have been of increasing concern in
   environmental conservation. Long-term exposure to heavy metal
   contamination, mainly through food and water, could be harmful to human
   health. It is therefore critical to understand the quantitative
   comparisons and combined effects of different heavy metals in common
   seafood species, such as oysters. This work studied the long-term
   spatiotemporal trends and health risk assessment of oyster arsenic (As),
   cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) levels
   in the coastal waters of northern South China Sea. Cultured oysters
   (Crassostrea rivularis) from 23 estuaries and harbors in the coastal
   areas of northern South China Sea in 1989-2015 were analyzed for the
   spatiotemporal trends of the six heavy metal levels. Metal pollution
   index (MPI), target hazard quotient (THQ), and hazard index (HI) were
   used for quantifying the exposure of the six heavy metals to human
   health through oyster consumption. Principal component analysis (PCA)
   was used for assessing the relative importance of the six metals in
   oyster heavy metal distribution patterns in the northern South China
   Sea. Overall, the As, Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb, and Zn levels in oysters from the
   northern South China Sea generally declined from 1989 to 2015, stayed
   relatively high (MPI = 2.42-3.68) during 1989-2000, gradually decreased
   since 2000, and slightly increased after 2010. Oyster heavy metal levels
   were highest in the Pearl River Estuary (MPI = 1.20-5.52), followed by
   west Guangdong and east Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan coastal waters.
   This pattern is probably because economics and industry around the Pearl
   River Estuary have been growing faster than the other areas of this work
   in the recent two decades, and it should be taken as a hotspot for the
   monitoring of seafood safety in southern China. Principal component
   analysis indicated that Cu, Zn, and Cd were the most important metals in
   the long-term distributions of oyster heavy metal levels in the northern
   South China Sea. Health risk assessment suggested that the risk of the
   six heavy metals exposure through oyster consumption were relatively
   high during 1989-2005 (THQ = 1.01-5.82), significantly decreased since
   2005 (THQ < 1), and slightly increased after 2010.},

Abstract = {The zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha was tested as an indicator of
   heavy metal exposure in urban waters of Vienna, Austria. Mussels, two
   sediment fractions, suspended matter, and filtrate were collected over
   one annual cycle at five sampling stations. Dreissena was dissected into
   five body parts: viscera, gill, foot, byssus, and shell, to determine
   tissue-specific metal accumulation. Cadmium, lead, copper, and zinc were
   measured by AAS. There was no clear relationship between (relatively
   low) metal concentrations in ambient compartments and in zebra mussel
   bodies. Therefore, D. polymorpha must be regarded as a poor suitable
   indicator tool under near-background contamination situations.
   Tissue-specific metal accumulation showed that cadmium was mainly stored
   in soft body parts. Lead, copper, and zinc showed significantly highest
   concentrations in the byssal threads. Metal concentrations and
   distribution patterns within the mussel's body must be interpreted as a
   result of(unknown) internal metal treatment/regulation. Excretion of
   lead, copper, and zinc via the byssus complex probably is an effective
   strategy for preventing toxic injury in D. polymorpha. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {Using artificial mussels (AMs), this study reports and compares
   time-integrated level of eleven trace metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg,
   Mn, Ni, Pb, U, Zn) in Karnafuli River estuary and coastal area of the
   Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh. Through this study, ``hot spots{''} of metal
   pollution were identified. The results may demonstrate that the
   Karnafuli Estuary, and adjacent coastal area of Chittagong, Bangladesh
   are highly polluted by high risk metals (cadmium, chromium, copper,
   mercury, nickel, lead, uranium). Agricultural, domestic and industrial
   wastes directly discharged into the waterways have been identified as
   the main causes of metal pollution in Chittagong, Bangladesh. The high
   level of metal pollution identified may impact on local water quality,
   and seafood catch, livelihoods of people and public health resulting
   from seafood consumption. There is a need for regular monitoring to
   ascertain that local water quality with respect to metal levels are
   within acceptable levels to safeguards both environmental health and
   public health. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The Gulf of Paria is bordered by both Trinidad and Venezuela, from which
   various metallic pollutants and other contaminants can originate. The
   Gulf is still a significant source of fish, crabs and shellfish for
   human consumption to both countries, where concerns over the quality of
   this marine environment have been long expressed but never property
   addressed. In addition, the circulatory current patterns in the Gulf
   ensure that contaminants originating from either country are likely to
   affect both countries eventually. Heavy metals were determined in
   oysters (Crassostrea rhizophorae and C. virginica), green mussels (Perna
   viridis) and sediments from the Gulf of Paria. Samples were obtained at
   four sites in Trinidad and three sites in Venezuela in the Gulf of
   Paria, in addition to comparative samples collected from three sites on
   the north coast of Venezuela. Edible tissues of twelve shellfish from
   each location were blended and aliquots digested with concentrated
   nitric acid, for extraction of cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel
   and zinc. The solutions were analysed by flame atomic absorption
   spectroscopy. Mercury was extracted with a mixture of nitric,
   hydrochloric and sulphuric acids and determined by cold vapour atomic
   absorption. Sediments were oven-dried at 60 degrees C, before being
   similarly extracted. Results showed that mercury in sediments at all
   sites in Trinidad and Venezuela exceeded NOAA and Canadian sediment
   quality guidelines, while cadmium, copper, nickel, lead and zinc also
   exceeded these guidelines at several sites. Heavy metal levels in
   oysters and green mussels varied widely with location. However, oysters
   from the Gulf of Paria contained significantly higher mean levels of
   cadmium, copper, nickel and zinc than those from the north coast of
   Venezuela, but this difference was not apparent in mussels. Cadmium,
   mercury and zinc in sediments were significantly correlated with those
   of mussels, but not of oysters, in which copper and zinc at several
   sites in the Gulf of Paria exceeded local maximum permissible levels (Cu
   = 20 mu g g(-1) wet wt; Zn = 50 mu g g(-1) wet wt) for human
   consumption. These findings indicate that while mussels may be better
   biological indicators of heavy metal pollution in sediments than
   oysters, the latter may provide copper and zinc contamination. Further
   research is needed to determine the most appropriate biological
   indicators of heavy metal and other pollutants in the local marine
   environment and to develop protocols for their use.},

Abstract = {Heavy metal concentrations of mercury, cadmium, lead, zinc, cooper,
   nickel, manganese, and chromium in Mytilus galloprovincialis were
   investigated to provide information on pollution of Safi coastal area,
   since these metals have the highest toxic potential. The concentration
   of Hg and Pb was determined by AFS and ICP-MS methods, respectively,
   whilst the remaining metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Zn, and Ni) were quantified
   by AAS. High lead, cadmium, chromium, and mercury levels were registered
   in tissue samples collected from two stations near the Jorf Lihoudi and
   Safi city, while elevated concentration of manganese and zinc
   (14.70-25.30 mg kg(-1) and 570-650 mg kg(-1) dry wt, respectively) were
   found in mussel Specimens from Cap Cantin. The high levels of nickel
   found respectively in the areas near the industrial area being of
   concern in terms of environmental health need frequent monitoring. The
   metal concentrations recorded at the clean stations may be considered as
   useful background levels to which to refer for comparison within the
   Atlantic coast. M. galloprovincialis are suitable biomonitors to
   investigate the contamination levels of heavy metals pollution face a
   different human activity in this coastal area of the Atlantic coast. (c)

Abstract = {The ranges of concentrations of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn of the soft tissues of
   C. corteziensis collected in seven coastal lagoons of NW Mexico were
   1.55-7.45, 17.50-166.36, 4.13-9.49 and 245.34-2,304.12 mu g/g (dry
   weight), respectively. Their distributions were not consistent and there
   were no seasonal trends, indicating different point sources of the
   metals in each lagoon. The mean Cd and Pb concentrations were 5.34 and
   6.30 mu g/g (dry weight), which are higher than the values indicative of
   polluted areas. Our data indicate that only the levels of Cd are a
   possible health risk in six of these lagoons, and only in the case of
   regular local consumers. In one, Cu and Zn reach levels of concern.},

Abstract = {The concentration of cadmium and lead ions was determined in digestive
   gland and mantle of mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) from five
   aquaculture stations located in the Gulf of Naples (Southern Italy,
   Tyrrhenian Sea). Metallothionein (MT) levels in the same tissues were
   also evaluated. This gulf represents a greatly urbanized area,
   characterized by an important commercial port and past industrial
   activities, terminated in the last decade of the 20th century. The
   results were compared with those obtained from mussels cultivated in a
   more pristine neighbouring area. Data demonstrate that the amount of
   both metals found in mussels harvested at the highly anthropogenic sites
   in the Gulf of Naples was comparable with that found in mussels from the
   more naturalistic site. The content of both cadmium and lead was not
   related with that of MT. Indeed, the amount of both metals in the
   digestive gland was greater than in the mantle, whereas the MT
   preferentially accumulated in the mantle. Possibly, the MT content in
   mantle was associated to the physiological function of the tissue,
   rather than heavy metals exposure.},

Abstract = {Variable and occasionally high concentrations of cadmium in wild oysters
   at a remote location with the potential to develop aquaculture
   enterprises motivated research into the distribution and sources of
   metals in oysters, seawater, sediment, suspended solids and
   phytoplankton.
   Saccostrea mytiloides and Saccostrea mordax contained cadmium
   concentrations exceeding the food standard maximum level (ML) at three
   of four sites. At one site with high zinc levels in sediment, oyster
   cadmium levels were below the ML. Metal levels in seawater were not
   correlated with cadmium levels in oysters but high cadmium/zinc ratios
   were measured in Trichodesmittm erythraeum blooms.
   We suggest that oysters accumulate cadmium mainly from annual
   phytoplankton blooms except at sites where zinc availability is
   sufficiently high to prevent uptake though a mechanism of antagonistic
   exclusion. Knowledge of the source and uptake mechanisms of cadmium in
   oysters should lead to new management strategies to reduce cadmium
   levels in farmed oysters.},

Abstract = {Arsenic (As), Cadmium (Cd), Chromium (Cr), Copper (Cu), Lead (Pb), and
   Zinc (Zn) concentrations in Manila clam from Liaodong Bay (China) were
   determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.
   Tissue-specific bioaccumulation, geographical variability (using metal
   pollution indices) and health risks (using target hazard quotients and
   maximum daily consumption values) were assessed. Cd concentrations were
   high at all sampling sites, particularly S6 and S7, where it reached
   Category III. Other metal concentrations were high at S7 (As), S1 (Cr),
   S5 (Pb), and S5 and S7 (Zn). As, Cr and Cu accumulated to a higher
   degree in the viscera than muscles, but Cd accumulated more in muscles
   than viscera. Heavy metal (HM) contamination was worse in the west than
   that in the east. The Cd target hazard quotients were greater than 1,
   but the other HM target hazard quotients were less than 1 at all sites,
   indicating Cd posed the greatest health risks to humans The maximum
   daily consumption values also indicated Cd poses health risks.},

Abstract = {The hard clams (Meretrix lusoria) that are cultured in Taiwan have
   suffered high mortalities each spring and/or summer since 1969.
   Environmental factors, pollution and infectious diseases have been
   implicated, but no single factor has been shown to lead directly to
   large-scale death of the cultured hard clam. In the present study,
   attempts were made to examine the effects of heavy metals on the
   susceptibility of the hard clam to birnavirus infection. First we
   determined the stability of the clam birnavirus in sea, brackish, fresh
   waters at 4, 15 and 26 degrees C and in solutions containing different
   concentrations of Zn2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and Hg2+. For each heavy metal
   cation, two concentrations which had no influence on clam birnavirus
   infectivity were selected and used to treat the hard clams before and
   after virus infection. In experiment I, clams were immersed in 10(5.0)
   TCID50/ml virus solution for 24 h and subsequently exposed to one of the
   heavy metals. Cumulative mortalities of clams were 20 similar to 52\% in
   most experimental groups although mortalities reached 91\% in infected
   clams exposed to high concentrations of copper. Tn experiment II, groups
   of 60 clams were: exposed to one of the heavy metals for 7 days and then
   infected with the virus, while controls were only expose to heavy
   metals. Mortalities of clams in the experimental groups reached 65
   similar to 90\% within 28 days, while only 10\% mortalities were
   observed in the groups that were exposed to either heavy metals or virus
   infection alone.},

Abstract = {Green-lipped mussels, Perna viridis, were collected from Kat O, Yim Tin
   Tsai, Ma Liu Shui and Tap Mun around Tolo Harbour and six local markets
   in Hong Kong (Aberdeen, Shau Kei Wan, Kowloon City, Mongkok, Yuen Long)
   and Shenzhen (Dongmun) between July 1994 and February 1995 and analysed
   for cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb) and
   zinc (Zn). The metal concentrations of mussels collected from the study
   sites were Cd (0.45-1.44 mu g/g), Cr (0.82-4.89 mu g/g), Cu (6.02-23.99
   mu g/g), Ni (3.25-6.87 mu g/g), Pb (2.02-4.36 mu g/g) and Zn (90-135 mu
   g/g), while those from the markets were Cd (0.27-1.44 mu g/g), Cr
   (1.09-3.30 mu g/g), Cu(9.05 17.8 mu g/g), Ni (2.44-5.25 mu g/g), Pb
   (1.17-5 mu g/g) and Zn (51-103 mu g/g). The metal concentrations were
   below the maximum permissible levels set by the Hong Kong Government. In
   addition, seasonal variation of metal accumulation in mussels was
   investigated in Yim Tin Tsai and Ma Liu Shui and a reduction in the
   total heavy metal concentrations during winter was noted. The
   non-carcinogenic hazard index of mussels collected from Tolo Harbour and
   from Hong Kong markets was between 0.46 and 1.36 compared with those
   from Shenzhen markets (0.85-1.46), which indicated a low but possible
   risk in consuming the mussels. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Levels of barium, cadmium, chromium, copper, mercury and vanadium were
   determined by plasma emission spectroscopy in sediments and oysters
   (Crassostrea virginica) in the Palizada, Chumpan and Candelaria rivers,
   which flow into the Terminos Lagoon, state of Campeche, Mexico. The
   relation between the condition index of the oyster and the detected
   elements were determined as well. Significant relations were observed
   between copper (r = -0.825, p < 0.05) and chromium (r = -0.787, p <
   0.05), which indicates the oysters' affectation by ingesting both
   elements; concurrently, the results confirm that oysters present high
   tolerance to heavy metals. The average concentration of cadmium (2.05 mu
   g/g), chromium (1.82 mu g/g) and copper (115.55 mu g/g) in rainy-season
   climate exceeded the limits for marine mollusks regarding different
   health standards. It was found that the rainy season, the sediment
   characteristics and organic matter content have a great influence on the
   transport and availability of heavy metals.},

Abstract = {Cadmium and zinc concentrations were determined in hepatopancreatic
   tissues of Mytilus galloprovincialis, reared in three non-contaminated
   hatcheries of the Gulf of Trieste (Northern Adriatic Sea). Mussels were
   collected in 13 sampling exits with monthly frequency for verifying
   possible seasonal variations. Freeze dried hepatopancreatic tissues were
   dissolved by nitric acid procedure using a microwave system; analysis of
   Zn and Cd followed by AAS technique.
   Metal concentrations were below the critical values for mollusc soft
   tissues, but xenobiotic cadmium had values requiring monitoring
   attention. Cadmium and zinc showed moderate variations along the months,
   with a slight winter maximum followed by a summer pre-spawning minimum,
   matching the seasonal trends of temperature/salinity. The estuarine site
   appears to have the best quality of the examined area in terms of metal
   contents. The results can constitute a guideline for the water quality
   in the Northern Adriatic Sea, and permit comparisons with the quality of
   other areas of the Mediterranean Sea. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {Biological and fishery features of Panopea sp. clams have been studied
   in northwest Mexico because of their importance for human consumption.
   However, the content of pollutants in their tissues, along with their
   implications have not been addressed yet. The concentrations of cadmium
   (Cd), copper (Cu), mercury (Hg), and zinc (Zn) in soft tissues of
   Panopea generosa and P. globosa clams were examined in this region by
   atomic absorption spectroscopy. The metal concentrations (lag/g wet
   weight) ranged from 6.5 to 14.2, 0.97-8.09, 0.60-1.18, and 0.01-0.07,
   for Zn, Cu, Cd, and Hg, respectively. This study proposes that metal
   presence is related to weathering, upwelling, and drainage from adjacent
   agricultural lands to the coast. According to the Official Mexican
   Standard (NOM-242-SSA1-2009) and the World Health Organization (WHO,
   2022), the metal content in siphon tissue indicates safe levels for
   human consumption.},

Title = {Heavy metal concentrations in sediments and in mussels from Argentinean
   coastal environments, South America},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {77},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Among environmental contaminants, heavy metals are currently considered
   to be some of the most toxic ones present worldwide due to their harmful
   effects on organisms and ability to bioaccumulate in aquatic systems. In
   this work, the concentration of heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni and Cr)
   in Brachidontes rodriguezii and in the fine sediments of several coastal
   sites at the southwest of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina is analyzed.
   The Bahia Blanca Estuary and Pehuen-Co beach are located in a highly
   complex oceanographic and ecological regional system, which creates the
   basis of one of the most valuable Argentinean habitats for fishing
   commercial species. An assessment, which involved analyzing distribution
   pattern of trace metals, comparative studies with sediment and
   ecological quality guidelines; and a sequential and integrated index
   analyses approach (containing Metal Pollution Index, Biosediment
   Accumulation Factor, Geo-accumulation Index (Igeo), Pollution Load Index
   and the mean Probable Effect Level quotients), was followed to estimate
   enrichment and risks of heavy metals in the sediments and in the mussels
   from these study areas. The results showed higher concentrations of some
   heavy metals (e.g., Cd, Cr and Ni) in mussels collected at Pehuen-Co,
   while no spatial differences in sediments were observed. According to
   the international environmental regulations, mean values of trace metals
   in mussels allowed to place both sites between ``unpolluted and
   moderately polluted{''} and between the ``low and medium category{''} of
   pollution. Furthermore, the mean concentrations found were within the
   detected ranges in other coastal sites worldwide.},

   sediments of the bay. In order to assess the availability of remobilized
   mercury to marine organisms, cultured mussels (M. galloprovincialis)
   were transplanted from pristine area to Kastela Bay, in the period from
   September 2000 to March 2001. Mussel samples were collected for the
   analysis of THg and MeHg in whole soft tissue, gills and digestive
   gland. Surface sediments and suspended matter were collected for the
   analysis of THg. Digestive gland was the target organ for the
   accumulation of THg, while concentrations of MeHg were similar in all
   analyzed tissues. The percentage of MeHg in mussel tissues (4-27\%) was
   characteristic for the areas contaminated with inorganic mercury. A
   significant negative correlation was observed between the THg
   concentration in the tissues and the percentage of MeHg. Concentrations
   of THg in mussel tissues, which were decreasing from the source of
   contamination in an anticlockwise direction towards the exit of the bay,
   were significantly positively correlated to THg content in sediment and
   suspended particles. Spatial distribution of mercury species (THg and
   MeHg) in different environmental compartments was in accordance with the
   prevailing circulation in the bay. Data obtained through 6 months of
   biomonitoring experiment indicated that digestive gland was more
   sensitive indicator of THg concentrations in the environment than the
   whole organism or gills. As for MeHg, all tissues were equally suitable
   as biomonitors of MeHg concentrations in the environment. (c) 2005

Title = {Heavy metals in the clam <i>Tivela mactroides</i> Born, 1778 (Bivalvia:

Abstract = {We compared heavy metal levels (manganese, iron, zinc, cadmium, copper,
   chromium, and lead) in tissues and shells of juveniles (13 +/- 2.2 mm),
   medium-size organisms with mature gonads (25 +/- 4.1 mm), and adults (35
   +/- 1.2 mm) of the clam Tivela mactroides from three different locations
   along the Venezuelan coast: Playa Guiria, on the northeastern coast, was
   not affected by environmental pollution, but Rio Chico and Boca de
   Paparo, influenced by the Tuy River on the central coast, were. Heavy
   metal concentrations were related to shelf size, with significant
   differences among populations and shell sizes. Specimens from Boca de
   Paparo and Rio Chico had the highest heavy metal concentrations in
   tissues and shells, in contrast with the levels found in specimens from
   Playa Guiria, in which chromium and lead were absent. The high heavy
   metal concentrations found in tissues from specimens collected at Boca
   de Paparo and Rio Chico were possibly of anthropogenic origin and
   generated by the Tuy River. The environmental conditions at Boca de
   Paparo may have favored the bioaccumulation of most heavy metals in
   specimen tissues. At Playa Guiria, however, the heavy metal
   concentrations were found to be within a natural range. Our results show
   that T mactroides is a good biological indicator of the presence of
   heavy metals in the littoral waters they inhabit.},

Title = {Oyster copper levels in the northern South China Sea from 1989 to 2015:
   spatiotemporal trend detection and human health implications},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Coastal heavy metal pollution has become an important topic for seafood
   safety and marine environmental protection. Unlike toxic heavy metals
   such as cadmium or chromium, copper is essential for oysters' growth but
   can inhibit their immune response to exotic stress when going above
   normal levels. Oysters with high copper levels can easily accumulate and
   transfer abnormal amounts of copper to upper trophic levels, and
   generate health risks for humans. This study investigated the
   spatiotemporal variability and health risk of copper levels in cultured
   oysters (Crassostrea rivularis) sampled from 23 harbors, bays, or
   estuaries along the northern South China Sea during 1989-2015. Overall,
   oyster copper concentrations in the study area ranged from 0.9 to 1897.0
   mu g/g wet weight with a mean of 210.0 (+/- 143.6) mu g/g and a median
   of 89.3 mu g/g. Although oyster copper levels in the southern China
   provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan showed an overall decrease
   during 1989-2015, they stayed relatively low since 1996 and increased
   slightly after 2010. Oyster copper levels in Guangdong were
   significantly higher than in Hainan and Guangxi. In Guangdong, oyster
   copper levels were highest in the Pearl River Estuary, followed by west
   Guangdong and east Guangdong. The health risk of copper exposure through
   oyster consumption increased in 2011-2015 compared with in 2006-2010. It
   is recommended that the human daily intake of cultured oysters in the
   study area should be reduced by half to minimize copper exposure. This
   study suggested that copper is one of the most important heavy metal
   contaminants in coastal and estuarine ecosystems of the northern South
   China Sea.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the results of the second year of monitoring of
   heavy metal contamination in the Croatian coastal area using the
   Mediterranean blue mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) as indicator
   species. The levels of essential (Cu, Zn) and non-essential (Cd, Pb, Cr)
   metals were determined in the whole soft tissue of mussels collected
   from 28 locations along the Eastern Adriatic coast. Examination of the
   spatial pattern of contaminants revealed three types of metal
   distribution. Zinc (58-170 mg kg(-1) dry wt.) was uniformly distributed
   across all the sites, while concentrations of Cd (0.17-1.57 mg kg(-1)
   dry wt.) and Cr (0.92-2.61 mg kg(-1) dry wt.) were elevated in certain
   regions. However, these values were not significantly different from
   those found at the stations with no known point sources of
   contamination. Elevated concentrations of lead and copper were recorded
   in the areas with high input of industrial, harbor and urban wastes.
   Although a wide range of lead and copper concentrations was observed,
   most of the values were lower than 1.5 mg kg(-1) dry m. and 14 mg kg(-1)
   dry wt., respectively.},

Abstract = {Levels of the heavy metals Copper (Cu), Zinc (Zn), Lead (Pb), Cadmium
   (Cd), Chromium (Cr), Nickel (Ni), Iron (Fe) and Manganese (Mn) were
   determined in coastal water, sediments and soft tissues of the gastropod
   limpet, Patella caerulea, and the bivalve, Barbatus barbatus, from seven
   different stations in the western coast of the Gulf of Suez. The
   concentrations of heavy metals in water ranged between 3.37-4.78,
   18.83-21.46, 2.75-3.17, 0.22-0.27, 0.99-1.21, 2.69-3.65, 3.75-4.56 mu g
   L-1 and 23.82-32.78 mg g(-1) for Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Cr, Ni, Mn and Fe,
   respectively. The corresponding concentration values in the sediments
   were 8.65-12.16, 51.78-58.06, 36.52-42.15, 3.23-3.98, 9.03-12.75,
   34.31-49.63, 3.28-4.56 and 64.20-70.22 mu g g(-1) for Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd,
   Cr, Ni, Mn and Fe, respectively. The highest accumulated metals were Fe,
   Zn and Mn in both P. caerulea and B. barbatus, while the lowest one was
   Cd. The accumulation of metals was more pronounced in P caerulea than B.
   barbatus. The highest concentrations of all metals in water, sediments
   and mollusca were recorded at Adabiya harbour north of the Gulf, while
   the lowest concentrations were recorded at Gabal El-Zeit and Hurghada.
   Land based activities and ships awaiting berth are the main source of
   metal pollution in the northern part of the Gulf. (c) 2006 Published by

Abstract = {The interest of culturing bivalved shellfish (including mussels, clams,
   oysters etc.), has increased in recent years, but the consumption has
   been hampered both by high levels of heavy metals and toxic algae. The
   levels of heavy metals (Hg, Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu and As) were determined in
   soft tissues of different shellfish from Zhejiang coastal waters, East
   China Sea. The average concentrations of the heavy metals analyzed
   exhibited the following decreasing order: Zn > Cu > As > Cd > Pb > Hg.
   Comparison of heavy metals concentrations among species indicated that
   Bivalves clearly have significant potential as useful bioindicators;
   however, the results indicated that no one species is universally
   suitable, as is true of any organism used in these studies. The
   distribution of the metals was also investigated along the Zhejiang
   coast, which the results showed the mean concentration of Hg and Cd
   detected did not vary greatly and presented a similar spatial pattern at
   different sampling stations, the concentrations of Zn and Pb were highly
   variable at different sampling sites. The amounts of heavy metals in
   soft tissue of shellfish were also compared with those from the related
   species from other seas in China and world marine waters. The results
   suggested that the coastal area might be considered relatively
   unpolluted with heavy metals and the concentrations of metals in
   shellfish also below the seafood safety limits for human consumption.},

Title = {Spatial Variability of Heavy Metals in Native Oysters From an
   Anthropogenically Impacted Estuary in Northeastern Brazil},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},

Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {This brief research compares the bioconcentration of heavy metals (Cd,
   Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Zn) in the soft tissues of native oysters
   Crassostrea rhizophorae (Guilding, 1828) from two areas in the Potengi
   estuary, northeastern coast of Brazil. The purpose was to test the
   hypotheses of relevant differences in bioaccumulation while the
   environmental conditions change upstream. The downstream station showed
   higher concentrations for cadmium and nickel, and the upstream one
   revealed increased values for body weight, condition index, chromium,
   lead, and zinc (p < 0.05). The copper variation between sites was
   negligible, but as for zinc and chromium, the metal content observed was
   above guidance levels. Results revealed two aspects that were mainly
   influencing the bioavailability and bioaccumulation of metals in
   oysters. First, the predominance of marine or riverine characteristics
   of each site, and second, the relative proximity to the point of
   introduction of the pollutant even though stations were not quite far
   apart. C. rhizophorae accumulated heavy metals in significant
   concentrations, endorsing its efficiency as a biomonitor.},

Abstract = {The concentrations of cadmium, copper and zinc in mussel and sediment
   samples collected together from eight different geographical coastal
   areas of Chile were determined. The mussels studied were `Chorito
   Maico', `Almejas' and `Navajuelas Chilenas' (Perumytilus purpuratus,
   Semelle solida and Tagellus dombeii, respectively). Sampling was carried
   out in July and September 1992 and January and April 1993 (winter,
   spring, summer and autumn seasons in Chile, respectively). The metal
   levels in these mussels varied among species; there were several sites
   where the metal concentrations in molluscs approached or exceeded the
   criteria levels for Cd, Cu and Zn in shellfish products: 1, 10 and 50
   ppm ww respectively, which are regarded as safe levels for human
   consumption. The results of metal levels in sediments showed two areas
   clearly polluted with Cu. Strong relationships between Cu concentrations
   in the three molluscs and sediments were found; weak correlations were
   observed for Zn in S. solida. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd},

   body weight being more in first 10 days. Copper and mercury accelerated
   the respiratory rate, while cadmium depressed it. Acceleration of
   respiratory rate was high on 10th day but decreased on 20th and 30th
   days and it was proportional to concentration of the metals in the
   medium. The significance of long term bio-assay is discussed.},

Abstract = {The concentrations of cadmium, lead and zinc were determined in the soft
   tissue of oysters ( Ostrea edulis L.) from three locations in the Mali
   Ston Bay on the south-eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea. The sampling
   was performed during two periods of breeding cycle, in summer ( age
   similar to 1 year) and winter ( age similar to 20 months, consumption
   size). The concentrations of cadmium, lead and zinc measured in the
   oyster soft tissue showed considerable spatiotemporal variations that
   could be attributed to seasonal differences in the freshwater inflow
   which varied between the study locations. Median concentrations measured
   at different locations and in different time periods ranged from 0.303
   to 0.969, 0.13 to 0.32 and 208.9 to 650.0 mu g/g wet weight for cadmium,
   lead and zinc, respectively. Although metal concentrations do not exceed
   the maximal legally approved limits according to the legislation of the
   Republic of Croatia and EU, more knowledge of their spatiotemporal
   distribution - of cadmium in particular - would contribute to the
   sustainable future development of oyster farming in Croatian waters.},

Title = {Trends of total cadmium, copper, and zinc in the zebra mussel

Abstract = {This study examines spatial and temporal variability of bioaccumulation
   of cadmium, copper, and zinc in tissues of zebra mussels in the upper
   reach of the St. Lawrence River which originates at the outflow of Lake
   Ontario. It was hypothesized that concentrations of these metals in
   mussel tissues would decline over time and decrease with increasing
   distance from the outlet of Lake Ontario as a result of on-going efforts
   to reduce contaminant discharges into the lake. Size of mussels was also
   evaluated as a factor influencing bioaccumulation. Mussels were
   collected annually in October from six sites from 1994 to 2005,
   including one site near a local industry. Individuals were grouped into
   five or more size classes per site in each year. Soft tissues were
   analyzed for total cadmium, copper and zinc. Concentrations of cadmium
   and copper in tissues varied significantly both spatially and
   temporally. Cadmium concentrations were elevated at most sites; copper
   concentrations were moderately elevated compared with other studies in
   the Lake Ontario basin and St. Lawrence River. Zinc showed the most
   uniformity in mussels possibly due to internal regulation and to low
   levels of environmental exposure. Animal size correlated with copper
   concentrations of tissues in approximately 30\% of samples but
   infrequently for cadmium and zinc. Cadmium and copper levels were found
   to decline downstream over time. Inter-annual variability of metal
   concentrations in mussel tissues suggests utilization in long-term
   monitoring programs to discern significant trends.},

Title = {Assessment of mercury and lead contamination using the bivalve

Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Buenaventura Bay is considered the main estuary on the Pacific coast of
   Colombia, because of port and industrial activities. Mining and
   agriculture are major sources of contamination in the estuary. This
   study used the bivalve Anadara tuberculosa to evaluate the presence of
   mercury and lead in the Dagua River estuary (Colombia), one of the main
   tributaries coming into the bay. Five samplings for sediments and six
   for tissues of A. tuberculosa were carried out between 2016 and 2017.
   Additionally, a series of bioassays were conducted to determine its
   ability to bioaccumulate metals. A mean mercury concentration of 0.57
   +/- 0.74 mg(star)kg 1 and lead concentration of 0.87 +/- 0.68
   mg(star)kg(-1) in sediment were found. Bioassays allowed us to conclude
   that at low mercury exposure con-centrations (0.25 mg(star)kg1), lesions
   are generated in animal tissue, mainly in sexual cells. The high
   concentra-tions of mercury found in organisms exceed the maximum
   permitted concentration established in Colombia. In addition, the
   contamination factors for mercury and lead were considered very high.
   This research aims at contributing to the use of Anadara tuberculosa, as
   prospective bioindicator for pollution biomonitoring in mangrove coastal
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {To evaluate Lebanon coastal contamination by trace metals (Pb, Cd, and
   V), we measured their distributions in marine sediments and in
   bioindicator mussels (Brachidontes variabilis) along the Lebanese
   coastal zone. Seven sampling sites, Itanieh, Jiyeh, Beirut, Byblos,
   Batroun, Tripoli, and Arida, were selected. Trace-metal concentrations,
   determined in `pelitic fraction of the sediment (<63 gm), were the
   highest in Tripoli sediments for Pb (104.4 mu g g(-1)) and Cd (0.23 mu g
   g(-1)), and in Arida for V (270 lig CI). In B. variabilis, the highest
   Pb concentrations corresponded to mussels collected from Batroun (6.32
   mu g g(-1)), whereas the highest Cd concentrations were obtained in the
   Palms Island (off Tripoli) (1.3 mu g g(-1)) and the highest V levels in
   Batroun (4.94 mu g g(-1)). The determination of the geoaccumulation
   index shows that the investigated sediments on the Lebanese coast are
   unpolluted with Cd, moderately to strongly polluted with V at Arida, and
   extremely polluted with Pb at Tripoli. Pb concentrations in mussels B.
   variabilis are low compared with levels obtained in polluted areas in
   the world. However, Cd levels in the studied bioinclicators at Batroun
   and Tripoli are similar to those obtained in other Mediterranean
   moderately polluted sites. High Cd and V levels in mussels collected at
   Batroun clearly show the anthropogenic impact of the nearby fertilizer
   plant.},

Abstract = {The heavy metal pollution status of oyster reefs has been assessed with
   respect to ten metals pollutants in seawater, sediments, and tissues of
   above two oysters (soft tissues and shells) for assessing the pollution
   status in a short food chain in Hab River Delta. The results showed that
   heavy metals accumulated in M. bilineata were higher than those in M.
   cuttackensis. Simultaneously, the population of M. bilineata species has
   been ironically decreasing as a results of high pollution. The
   determined concentrations revealed a significant differences in their
   profiles among sediments, seawater and bioaccumulation in tissues and
   shells of two native oysters. The present study also compared these
   metal concentrations with national and international database by
   applying different pollution indices. Heavy metals in all samples were
   above the national environmental quality standards (NEQS-Pakistan). High
   level of pollution with an alarming condition of Hab River Delta need
   more attention for coastal management.},

Abstract = {Background. For its flesh and flavor, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea
   gigas is cultivated worldwide, but as filter feeders, this bivalve
   bioaccumulates heavy metals from different pollution sources, rendering
   them unsafe for human consumption. Goals. We carried out this study to
   assess the heavy metal concentrations in cultivated oysters from a farm
   located on the southeastern coast of the Gulf of California during 2011.
   Methods. Oyster samples were analyzed monthly (March-December 2011) for
   cooper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), zinc
   (Zn), arsenic (As), and mercury (Hg). Results. The mean values (mu g
   g(-1), dry weight) for each metal were Cu = 51.42 +/- 25.92, Cr = 24.97
   +/- 32.38, Cd = 13.84 +/- 4.22, Ni = 10.26 +/- 12.18, Pb = 2.18 +/-
   1.28, As = 0.37 +/- 0.08, Zn = 267.42 +/- 92.29, and Hg = 0.02 +/- 0.01.
   Conclusions. The results suggest that metal burdens could be influenced
   by anthropogenic activities such as agriculture and aquaculture
   surrounding the culture zone. Cu, Cr, Cd, and Pb levels (mu g g(-1),
   fresh weight) were above the maximum permissible values and thus pose a
   threat to human health. Metal concentrations must be monitored
   periodically.},

Title = {Environmental assessment of oyster beds in the northern Arabian Gulf
   Coast of the United Arab Emirates},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {195},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The United Arab of Emirates (UAE) hosts valuable coastal and marine
   biodiversity, and oysters are one of the habitants of its marine
   ecosystem. Oysters play an essential role in the nearshore coasts where
   they work as an active filter. They filter nutrients, phytoplankton,
   sediments, heavy metals, and toxins out of the water, which improves the
   water quality. This is the first study that characterizes oyster bed
   habitats in the UAE by analyzing water quality parameters, polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs)and heavy
   metals in water, sediments and oyster samples collected from five
   locations along the coasts of Sharjah, Ajman, and Umm al Quwain. Oyster
   bed areas supported a diverse assemblage of benthic life including
   oysters, scallops, pen shells, hard corals, and macroalgae. Mobile
   species in these habitats included groupers, emperors, snappers, sea
   snakes, among others. The phytoplankton assemblages were dominated by
   diatoms, dinoflagellates, and small cryptophytes. Harmful diatom
   Pseudonitzschia was found in all locations. No detectable concentrations
   of PAHs and OCPs were reported in this study, and water quality
   parameters were within the acceptable levels for the region. On the
   other hand, water quality index was reported marginal, mostly due to the
   presence of higher than acceptable concentrations of chromium and
   mercury in all sites studied. Bioconcentration factors concluded that
   oysters were able to bioconcentrate metals such as arsenic, cadmium,
   chromium, and zinc, when compared to water. No detectable concentrations
   of lead and mercury were reported in oysters, suggesting higher
   depuration rates for those metals.},

Abstract = {An abnormal increase of copper concentrations was observed in both the
   oyster tissues and sediments of the Sien-San coastal area in the
   north-western part of Taiwan, As much as 200 and 5000 ppm of copper was
   found in sediments and oysters. These sucessive concentrations of copper
   were introduced to the coastal area within a short period of about 4 yr,
   Copper concentrations increased 50 and 100-fold respectively in oyster
   tissues and sediments. The green oyster phenomenon occurred as a result
   of these rapid increases in metal concentrations. The appearance of
   green oysters and the abnormal concentrations of copper demonstrated
   that the Sien-San coastal area is undergoing a drastic change as a
   result of copper pollution. This pollution problem represents a serious
   threat to the local fishing community. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {This study was designed to compare the metallothionein (MT) response
   capacity of two freshwater bivalves, Corbicula fluminea and Dreissena
   polymorpha, along an environmental gradient of polymetallic pollution.
   The bivalves were transplanted into 4 stations in southwestern France,
   with a cadmium and zinc pollution gradient. MT and metal concentrations
   were measured in the soft bodies of the clams and mussels over 2.5
   months. In the zebra mussels, variations in MT concentrations were
   strictly correlated to progressive Cd and Zn bioaccumulation. In
   contrast, the faster response in the clams appeared positively
   correlated to Cd accumulation only, with the activation of efficient
   detoxification mechanisms which limited Cd bioaccumulation and reduced
   Zn concentrations over time. Nevertheless, despite stronger metal
   accumulation factors in D. polymorpha, C. fluminea revealed higher
   sensitivity of MT response along the pollution gradient. (c) 2006

Title = {Heavy metals pollution and health risk assessment in farmed scallops:
   Low level of Cd in coastal water could lead to high risk of seafood},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {208},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Scallops are one of the most common bivalves, large-scale farmed in the
   coastal areas of China. Three species of scallops (Chlamys farreri,
   Argopecten irradians and Patinopecten yessoensis) from 10 samples sites
   along the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea were collected to investigate
   species-specific and tissues-specific bioaccumulation, spatial-temporal
   distribution and health risks for people. Cd must be paid attention
   since Cd concentrations in 96\% of scallop samples exceeded standard
   with the highest Cd bioaccumulation potentials (BCF) >10,000 while those
   of the other metals were less than the corresponding limits except Zn
   with exceeding-limit percentage of 13\%. The metal pollution index
   values showed that A. irradians could accumulate more metals than the
   other two species, and scallops in the Bohai Sea were polluted more
   seriously by heavy metals than in the Yellow Sea. The capacities of
   tissues in scallops to accumulate metals generally followed the order of
   digestive gland > gill > adductor muscle. However, Zn accumulated in
   gill was more than that in digestive gland and muscle. Adults and
   children would face the non-cancer risks because of the accumulation Cd
   in scallops based on health risk assessment. Cd was the major
   contributor of health risk to account for 85\% of total hazard quotient
   and 48\% of total cancer risk. Scallops could accumulate Cd rapidly from
   ambient environments to cause health risks according to the
   transplantation test. Moreover, the recommended maximum edible amounts
   of whole scallops were 127/63 g/week for adult/children on the basis of
   the provisional tolerance weekly intake. Humans are recommended to only
   consume adductor muscles for reducing health risks.},

Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {1986},
Volume = {92},

Abstract = {A regulation of internal levels of some essential metals has been
   observed in various animals, whereas the bioaccumulation of several
   non-essential metals parallels their overloads in water. In the mussel
   Mytilus edulis L., we have attempted to determine if such a phenomenon
   exists by comparing the patterns of accumulation of copper and zinc vs
   cadmium. With this aim, mussels collected in the Bay of Bourgneuf
   (France) in November 1983 were exposed to these metals for 16 d. At
   external levels of zinc as high as 100 .mu.g l-1, mussels were able to
   maintain a normal concentration in all groups of organs for 4 d. The
   ability of mussels to limit the bioaccumulation of copper and zinc
   varied from organ to organ, and decreased with higher levels of
   contamination and longer periods of exposure. In contrast, at the lowest
   experimental concentration and the lowest period of exposure, a
   significant increase of cadmium in mussel tissues was generally
   observed. Even at the highest sub-lethal doses, the levels of copper and
   zinc in mussel tissues were not much higher than the natural levels
   (contaminated:background ratios = 2.3 to 6.1), whereas the
   bioaccumulation of cadmium was less well restricted
   (contaminated:background ratios = 136 to 192). The use of mussels as a
   bioindicator of pollution seems doubtful for essential metals,
   particularly as regards short-term pollution, since the levels of these
   trace elements in the organisms are largely independent of their
   concentration in the ambient seawater.},

Title = {Metal accumulation in mussels of the Kuril Islands, north-west Pacific
   Ocean},

Volume = {53},

Abstract = {Concentrations of cadmium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, nickel and
   zinc were investigated in two species of mussel from the Kuril Islands
   in the north-western Pacific Ocean: the short-lived mussel Mytilus
   trossulus and the much larger and longer-lived Crenomytilus grayanus.
   The concentrations of most elements were low, and these reported levels
   are believed to reflect background values for pristine locations.
   However, both iron and zinc concentrations were elevated in some samples
   taken from areas of hydrothermal vent activity, and these are believed
   to reflect the enrichment of the two metals in solution at such sites.
   Furthermore, the concentrations of cadmium were unusually elevated in
   both species of mussel, especially in the longer-lived C. grayanus. The
   high accumulation of cadmium in mussels from the Kuril Islands is
   believed to reflect regional upwelling, but it is also postulated that
   filtration rates of the mussels are high due to low levels of suspended
   matter, and this leads to a high assimilation efficiency for cadmium.
   The distribution of cadmium amongst the tissues of C. grayanus is also
   reported, and the need for further ecotoxicological studies in the area
   is proposed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},

Abstract = {This study recompiled a national dataset to characterize the pollution
   level and health risk of cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), lead (Pb) and zinc
   (Zn) in oysters along the coastal areas of China. Results showed that
   the median concentrations of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn in nationwide oysters
   were 5.5, 335, 1.3 and 1280 mg/kg dry weight, respectively. Generally,
   oysters from the north coasts presented lower metal pollution and higher
   quality than those from the south. The regional characteristics of trace
   metals in oysters might be contributed by the inter-specific
   differences. Nationally, the noncarcinogenic risk posed by these four
   metals in oysters was relatively low, with the risk only occurring in a
   few hotspots such as the Pearl River Estuary and the Jiulong River
   Estuary. However, more attention should be paid to the carcinogenic risk
   of Cd, and priority should be given to formulating control measures to
   mitigate Cd pollution.},

Abstract = {To investigate the pollution level and evaluate the potential health
   risks of heavy metals, the concentrations of chromium (Cr), manganese
   (Mn), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As),
   selenium (Se), molybdenum (Mo), cadmium (Cd), antimony (Sb), and lead
   (Pb) were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry
   (ICP-MS) in 198 clams (Mactra veneriformis) collected from 11 sites of
   the Bohai Bay. The results showed that heavy metal concentrations in the
   clams were different at different sites (p <0.05). Mn was dominant with
   a percentage of 22.08-77.03\% in heavy metals, followed by Zn with
   12.66-57.11\%, and the concentration of Pb was the lowest with
   0.45-1.04\%. The potential health risk to consumers was evaluated by the
   target hazard quotient (THQ) and the maximum daily consumption rate
   (CR,). The results indicated that the THQs of Co were the highest with
   the values of 1.125, 1.665, and 1.144 at three sections; the values of
   other individual metals were <1, which indicated that consumption of
   clams from the study areas caused health risks due to Co. Moreover, the
   CRmax values also indicated the potential health risk caused by Co in
   clams consumed in this area. Pearson correlation analysis and principal
   component analysis (PCA) indicated that there were significantly
   positive or negative correlations between the heavy metals (p < 0.05),
   and the studied metals were divided into four groups. The results
   indicated that the concentrations of heavy metals in clams were affected
   not only by pollution sources but also by the characteristics of clams
   that could absorb selectively and accumulate special metals. This study
   offers important information on the pollution levels of heavy metals in
   clams and warns consumers of the health risks associated with the
   consumption of clams in the area. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Comparative toxicity of heavy metal compounds to the juvenile golden
   apple snail, <i>Pomacea</i> sp.},
Journal = {FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN},

Pages = {379-384},
Abstract = {Mercury, cadmium and copper which are heavy metal widely used in
   industry and contaminate aquatic ecosystems as toxic pollutants, were
   investigated for acute toxicity to the golden apple snail, Pomacea sp.
   The bioassay experiments in static water system were undertaken to
   determine the 24-, 48-. 72- and 96-hour mean lethal concentrations for
   the snail. The experiments were repeated three times. In addition,
   behavioral and morphological changes of exposed snails at each metal
   concentration were observed. Data obtained from the acute toxicity tests
   were evaluated using the probit analysis statistical method.
   The 24-hour LC50 values (upper and lower 95\% confidence limits) for the
   snail were estimated as 1.57 mg/l (0.92 and 2.67 mg/l) of mercury, 2.25
   mg/l (1.24 and 4.66 mg/l) of cadmium and 4.84 mg/l (3.17 and 8.35 mg/l)
   of copper. The 48-hour LC50 values were estimated as 0.57 mg/l (0.22 and
   0.96 mg/l) of mercury, 2.07 mg/l (1.54 and 3.54 mg/l) of cadmium and
   1.85 mg/l (1.06 and 0.90 mg/l) of copper. The 72-hour LC50 values were
   estimated as 0.17 mg/l (0.07 and 0.26 mg/l) of mercury, 0.68 mg/l (0.48
   and 0.90 mg/l) of cadmium and 0.92 mg/l (0.64 and 1.78 mg/l) of copper.
   The 96-hour LC50 values were estimated as 0.07 mg/l (0.05 and 0.10 mg/l)
   of mercury, 0.47 mg/l (0.28 and 0.84 mg/l) of cadmium and 0.12 mg/l
   (0.08 and 0.17 mg/l) of copper. Based on LC50 values after 24-, 48-, 72-
   and 96-hour exposure. mercury was more toxic than cadmium and copper. At
   the 24- and 72-hour cadmium was more toxic than copper. Conversely, at
   the 48- and 96-hour copper was more toxic than cadmium.
   In the metal bioaccumulation experiment, residues of mercury, cadmium
   and copper in the freshwater snail, Pomacea sp. were shown to be 334.91
   mg/kg dry weight, 126.56 mg/kg dry weight and 125.46 mg/kg dry weight,
   respectively after 96 hours. Copper was accumulated the least, while
   mercury was present in the greatest concentration. The results of this
   study indicate the possibility of using freshwater snail. Pomacea sp. as
   a biomonitor for heavy metal contaminants in freshwater resources.},

Title = {Heavy metals accumulation in bivalve mollusks collected from coastal

Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {189},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The distribution of six heavy metal and metalloids (As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Ni
   and Pb) was analyzed in 597 bivalve mollusks (8 species) collected from
   coastal areas of southeast China. Target hazard quotient, total hazard
   index, and target cancer risk were calculated to evaluate potential
   human health risks from bivalve consumption. The mean concentrations of
   As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Ni and Pb were 1.83, 0.581, 0.111, 0.0117, 0.268 and
   0.137 mg kg(-1) wet weight in bivalves. The average estimated daily
   intakes for As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Ni and Pb were 1.156, 0.367, 0.07, 0.007,
   0.167 and 0.087 mu g kg(-1) body weight/day. Health risk assessment
   showed that there was no non -carcinogenic health risk to general
   residents to these metals from consumption of bivalves. Cd intake
   through mollusks posed a potential cancer risk. Accordingly, regular
   monitoring for heavy metals, especially Cd is rec-ommended with respect
   to potential contaminant on marine ecosystems.},

Abstract = {In September 2021, the contents of the Pb, Cu, Cd, Zn, Ni, Fe, and Mn
   heavy metals were estimated in the tissues of the oyster Magallana gigas
   (= Crassostrea gigas) (Thunberg, 1793) and in the silty fraction of
   bottom sediments from mollusk habitats in coastal waters around the
   Muravyov-Amursky Peninsula, including the most polluted area off the
   western coast of Ussuri Bay of the Sea of Japan. It has been shown that,
   despite the reclamation of the landfill located here in 2010, which is
   the main source of metal pollution, copper is present in high
   concentrations in bottom sediments and tissues of oysters, giving them a
   green color. The mollusks living in this area also retain a high
   concentration of zinc. The concentrations of Pb, Cd, and Ni in oyster
   tissues over the past 20 years have decreased by 2-5 times in accordance
   with the decrease in the number of mobile forms of these metals in
   bottom sediments; however, they are still 3-6 times higher than regional
   estimates for polluted water areas. With the abnormal accumulation of
   copper, manganese demonstrates a decrease in the concentration in the
   tissues of oysters from the most polluted stations, reflecting the
   deterioration of the physiological state of mollusks. The results we
   obtained indicate the need to continue the remediation of the western
   coast of Ussuri Bay and monitor the pollution of coastal waters with
   metals.},

Abstract = {Pearl oysters (Pinctada imbricata) were held in the laboratory and
   exposed to various levels of the heavy metals lead and zinc and the

   Individual oysters were followed over the course of the experiment,
   allowing specific calculation of total oyster growth (wet weight) and
   shell growth. Significant reductions ill total oyster growth were
   observed when oysters were exposed to high concentrations (270 mu g L-1)
   of either zinc or lead. Exposure to the aliphatic hydrocarbons had no
   effect oil total oyster growth. High concentrations of lead completely
   halted shell growth. the first demonstration of pollutant induced
   cessation of biomineralization in pearl oysters. Conversely, exposure to
   moderate levels of lead and the long-chain hydrocarbon octacosane
   resulted in significant increases in shell width growth. The results
   from this study indicate that P. imbricata is relatively tolerant of the
   selected pollutants and could be deployed within a remediative context
   in moderately polluted coastal areas.},

Abstract = {The present research aims to evaluate the variation of several responses
   such as nitrogen and phosphorus excretion, catalase activity and total
   protein in the two species of marine mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis
   (Ain Tagoureite-Tipaza, Algeria) and Perna perna (Figuier-Boumerdes,
   Algeria), exposed to different sub-lethal concentrations of two heavy
   metals (copper, and lead). The measurement of the chemical and
   biochemical responses were made after an acute exposure period (the
   mussels' size is between 4.5 and 5.5 cm). The results showed that,
   through all exposure cycles, variations in temperature and salinity
   {[}0.10 +/- 0.05 degrees C >Delta T > 1.6 +/- 0.13 degrees C, 0.05 +/-
   0.02\% >Delta S > 0.65 +/- 0.03\%] are far from significant in order to
   interfere with the effect caused by copper or lead pollutant. In both
   species, the remarkable changes in nitrogen and phosphorus mineral
   matter under two metals effect are a physiological disturbance origin.
   Consequently, the catalase induction and the proteins depletion
   {[}Mytilus galloprovincialis: | - 0.138| >Delta{[}protein total] > | -
   1.601| (mg g-1 of flesh), Perna perna: | - 1.046| >Delta{[}protein
   total] > (0.56 mg g-1 of flesh)] during the contamination cycles
   reflected the oxidative stress caused with the varying levels. However,
   in decontamination cycles, the catalase enzymatic activity {[}Mytilus
   galloprovincialis ({[}Cu]=0.100 mg/l): {[}CAT] (day1) = 18.4, {[}CAT]
   (day3) = 50.06, and {[}CAT] (day11) = 29.3 U mg -1 of proteins, Perna
   perna({[}Cu] = 0.100 mg/l): {[}CAT] (day1) = 19.4, {[}CAT] (day3) =
   59.11, and {[}CAT] (day11) = 33.02 U mg -1 of proteins], has revealed
   the normal state return when the environment is free of contamination.
   Through these results, the good relevance of pollution indication in the
   two species depends essentially on their sensitivity and tolerance,
   causing physiological and/or metabolite responses will vary according to
   the xenobiotics and their dose. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Heavy metal pollution is considered a major problem worldwide. Heavy
   metals find their way to human body mainly through diet, water and air.
   Shellfish represents a major source of animal-derived protein, vitamins
   and trace elements; however, it may contribute to human exposure to
   heavy metals. This study was undertaken to monitor the toxic metal
   (lead, cadmium, mercury and arsenic) residues in six shellfish namely,
   shrimp, crab, crayfish, clam, oyster and mussel collected from fish
   markets in Ismailia governorate, Egypt. Moreover, metal-metal
   interactions were also analyzed. Furthermore, human health risk
   assessment was estimated. Finally, the effect of different cooking
   methods on the toxic metal load in the shrimp was investigated. The
   results declared a clear and significant variation in the accumulation
   pattern of each metal in the examined shellfish. Positive correlations
   in the accumulation pattern of some metals were also observed in this
   study. High and continuous dietary intake of shellfish may constitute
   health hazards among consumers. Grilling and barbecuing of shellfish
   lead to an increase in the concentrations of toxic metals. However,
   boiling and frying significantly reduced the metal load in the
   shellfish. Public health implications of the examined metals were also
   discussed.},

Title = {Levels and health risk assessment of mercury, cadmium, and lead in green
   mussel (Perna viridis) and oyster (Crassostrea iredalei) harvested
   around Manila Bay, Philippines},

Abstract = {The coastal provinces of Manila Bay contribute 38\% of mussel and
   oyster's production in the Philippines. However, concerns in the
   consumers' health are rising due to the possible pollution in the bay
   waters that may contaminate the bivalves. Thus, the present study
   determined the level of Hg, Cd, and Pb in green mussel (Perna viridis),
   oyster (Crassostrea iredalei), seawater as well as the potential health
   risk. Bivalves and seawater had levels of metals below the regulatory
   limit established by the country (Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic
   Resources; Department of Environment and Natural Resources) and the EU.
   The maximum estimated daily intake (EDI) of Hg (1.95 x 10-08 mg/kg/day)
   in mussel was from Seneguelasan (Cavite) during dry season (DS) while
   maximum EDI of Cd (8.48 x 10-08 mg/kg/day) in oyster was from Tibaguin
   (Bulacan) during wet season (WS) both in 5-9 years old (yo) male and
   female, respectively. For maximum EDI of Cd (2.70 x 10-08 mg/kg/day) and
   Pb (3.54 x 10-08 mg/kg/day) in the mussel, it was found in 10-19 yo male
   from Wawa (Bataan) during DS and WS. Whereas, maximum EDI of Hg (1.19 x
   10-08 mg/kg/day) and Pb (3.30 x 10-08 mg/kg/day) in oyster were found in
   40-59 yo male from Timalang Balsahan during DS. However, none of the
   bivalves showed higher EDI and weekly intake than the reference dose
   (EPA 1991; EPA IRIS 1989 and 2001) and provisional tolerable weekly
   intake (FAO/WHO 2000; 2007; 2011). Furthermore, no health risks were
   associated with the consumption of mussel and oyster as hazard quotients
   were <1. The possible cancer risks were estimated in four to six
   individuals out of 1 x 1007. The study recommends to have further risk
   assessment on other fishery commodities available in the area to secure
   the consumer's safety.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to analyze the concentrations of
   lead, cadmium and mercury in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and
   veined rapa whelks (Rapana venosa) caught in the Varna Bay of Black Sea
   and to evaluate the risk for human health from the presence of the three
   heavy metals. The highest average concentrations in mussels were those
   of cadmium (0.280 mg/kg), followed by lead (0.251 mg/kg) and mercury
   (0.017 mg/kg). Veined rapa whelks also showed highest levels of cadmium
   (1,113 mg/kg), followed by lead (0.045 mg/kg) and mercury (0.034 mg/kg).
   EDI values for adults consuming mussels and veined rapa whelks were
   below the published RfDo and PTWI values. All THQ and HI values were
   below 1. The consumption of M. galloprovincialis and R. venosa caught in
   the Varna Bay, Black Sea, did not pose any risk for the health of adult
   people as lead, cadmium and mercury were concerned.},

Abstract = {The Mandinga Lagoon in the Mexican State of Veracruz is an important
   ecological zone that produces 32\% of the oyster output in the state of
   Veracruz, the main oyster producer in Mexico. Samples of water,
   sediment, and oysters were collected in 2003 and 2004 to study heavy
   metal pollution. Metal concentrations were determined in water, soil,
   and oyster tissues from fresh and detoxified Crassostrea virginica, and
   histology samples were analyzed. Metal (Cr, Cd, and Pb) concentrations
   in water were within the Mexican legal limits. The recorded values in
   sediments corresponded to those not producing biological effects (ERL).
   In the tissues, the highest concentrations corresponded to Pb, above
   5.84 mu gg(-1) dry weight (d.w.); Cd was of 2.23 mu gg(-1) d.w., and Cr
   above 6 mu gg(-1) d.w. The metal levels detected in oysters exceeded the
   maximum permissible limits (MPL) for Cd and Pb, and oysters were unable
   to eliminate the concentrations of the bioaccumulated metals during the
   detoxification stage. The histopathological analysis revealed lesions in
   the digestive gland, edema, atrophy of epithelia in the digestive
   tubules, the presence of brown vesicles, hemocytic reaction, and
   necrosis. During detoxification, a higher number of epithelia were
   observed in the tubules, as well as an increase in brown vesicles and
   hemocytic reaction. Forty seven percent of oysters presented
   histopathological lesions related to metal concentrations. It is
   important to monitor metal concentrations, to detect the source of
   pollution, and to evaluate the effects on organisms to establish culture
   areas and adequate criteria for the exploitation of such an important
   fishery resource. Rev. Biol. Trop. 57 (4): 955-962. Epub 2009 December

Abstract = {An active biomonitoring experiment using mussels (Mytilus
   galloprovincialis) was performed in Pialassa Baiona, a mercury-polluted
   coastal wetland near Ravenna, Italy. Three stations (A, B, and C) were
   selected along the south to north axis. Following a 52-d field exposure,
   organisms transplanted in the southernmost polluted area (station A)
   showed mean mercury concentration values of 660 ng/g (dry weight), 4.4
   times the initial background level, and were still accumulating mercury.
   Mussels in both the central area (station B) and the northern area
   (station C) seemed to reach a steady state with mean mercury
   concentration values of 323 and 412 ng/g, respectively. This field
   experiment is the first study carried out in the Ravenna wetlands to
   evaluate mercury bioavailability in this environment. Finally, the
   efficiency of the population of Mytilus galloprovincialis selected for
   the field experiment as mercury bioaccumulators was tested in a
   laboratory experiment that revealed that up to 135 mu g/g (dry weight)
   could be reached after 77 d of exposure to mercury-polluted water.},

Abstract = {Mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis), clams (Venerupis decussatus) and
   oysters (Crassostrea gigas) were sampled seasonally during 20042005,
   from different coastal environments of Morocco in order to measure their
   accumulated heavy metal concentrations. The concentrations of Hg and Pb
   were determined by AFS and ICP-MS methods, respectively, whilst the
   remaining metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Zn and Ni) were quantified by AAS.
   The soft tissue concentrations of the mussels were on average 7.2 mg
   kg(-1) (U), 9.6 mg kg(-1) (Pb), 0.6 mg kg(-1) (Hg), 26.8 mg kg(-1) (Cu),
   8.8 mg kg(-1) (Cr), 292 mg kg(-1) (Zn), 20.8 mg kg(-1) (Mn) and 32.8 mg
   kg(-1) (Ni). The highest tissue heavy metal concentrations were recorded
   in the south from the industrial area of Jorf Lasfar. The relationships
   between metal concentration and season in each species showed very
   similar annual profiles with a peak observed around spring-summer.
   Statistical analysis indicated that different species showed different
   bioaccumulation of metals depending on study site and season. (C) 2007

Abstract = {High concentrations of metals are accumulated by edible marine
   resources, affecting human health. Marine gastropods have been
   commercially captured and consumed in Argentina for decades without
   official regulations or studies to guarantee their safety. In this
   study, metals (cadmium, aluminium, iron, zinc, copper and lead) were
   analysed for the first time in the edible marine gastropods Buccinanops
   globulosus, Adelomelon ancilla and Trophon geversianus and their
   surrounding sediments. Taking into account the maximum levels
   recommended by national and international regulations for food safety,
   we recommend consuming only the foot of these gastropod species. We
   recommend not consuming these gastropods from harbour areas due to
   concentrations of lead in sediments and tissues. Though the target
   hazard quotient (THQ) of cadmium was not high for the local community,
   it could be higher for other populations who consume molluscs more
   frequently, indicating a potential health risk of chronic exposure.
   Monitoring of these and other contaminants should be performed in order
   to ensure food safety of these marine resources.},

Abstract = {The Billion Oyster Project is a New York City-wide effort to reintroduce
   eastern oysters back into the New York Harbor and help improve water
   quality by reducing heavy metal concentrations in the environment. In
   particular, the bioaccumulation of mercury in oyster tissue was
   investigated in the New York Harbor oysters acquired from two sites.
   Mercury levels exceed the standard Environmental Protection
   Agency-recommended levels as the New York Harbor oysters exhibit mercury
   levels ranging from 0.36 +/- 0.05 to 0.55 +/- 0.08 mu g Hg g(-1) dry
   weight. In an ideal scenario, one billion of these oysters are roughly
   projected to capture a maximum of 110 g of mercury from the New York
   Harbor by 2030, assuming an average uptake of 0.55 mu g Hg g(-1) dry
   weight for every oyster added to the reef. In addition to the
   bioaccumulation of mercury within the oyster tissue, stunted physical
   growth of the oysters and abnormal discoloration of the tissue indicate
   the presence of other heavy metals. This study demonstrates the
   promising role that eastern oysters play in removing heavy metals, such
   as mercury, from their water environment and preview significant and
   measurable impacts on the ecosystem.

Title = {Mercury and methylmercury contamination in surficial sediments and clams
   of a coastal lagoon (Pialassa Baiona, Ravenna, Italy)},

Abstract = {The Ramsar site Pialassa Baiona is an intertidal brackish lagoon lying 5
   km north of the city of Ravenna and covering a surface area of about
   1100 ha. From 1958 to 1976 Pialassa Baiona was heavily impacted by
   industrial pollution; mercury, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
   polymers were among the most important pollutants which nowadays
   contaminate the sedimentary compartment. Following earlier
   investigations on total mercury (THg) distribution and bioavailability,
   this study is focused on mercury speciation in sediments and clams.
   Methylmercury (MMHg) concentrations were determined in surface sediments
   (0-5 cm) in different seasons, and compared to THg. Selected sediments
   were subjected to a sequential extraction procedure to study solid state
   THg distribution. Operationally, three fractions of inorganic mercury
   were defined: mobile mercury (Hg-m), humic acid complexed mercury
   (Hg-ha), and sulphide-bound mercury (Hg-s). THg and MMHg concentrations
   in sediments ranged in the 0.2-250 mug g(-1) and 0.13-45 ng g(-1) d.w.
   intervals, respectively. MMHg/THg ratios were higher in summer as well
   as in sites where the THg burden was lower; the highest MMHg/THg values
   were observed in Chiaro del Pontazzo, an area subjected to a drastic
   reduction of salinity.
   THg and MMHg concentrations were also determined in tissues of clams
   (Tapes philippinarum) collected in the lagoon. MMHg in clams felt in the
   180-470 ng g(-1) interval and accounts for 72-95\% of tissue THg. (C)

Title = {Bioaccumulation of trace metals and speciation of copper and zinc in
   Pacific oysters (<i>Crassostrea gigas</i>) using XANES/EXAFS
   spectroscopies},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},

Abstract = {Copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) concentrations in oyster soft tissues can be
   particularly high due to contamination, leading to extremely green/blue
   colors. This raises key questions regarding the behavior and speciation
   of trace metals in oyster soft tissues. This study investigated trace
   metal concentration profiles of contaminated Pacific oyster (Crassostrea
   gigas) soft tissues collected from trace metal-contaminated coastal area
   of Xiangshan District using inductively coupled plasma optical emission
   spectrometry (ICP-OES), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), Fourier-transform
   infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS). Moreover, Cu and Zn speciation in contaminated and
   non-contaminated oyster soft tissues were investigated by X-ray
   absorption near edge structure spectroscopy/extended X-ray absorption
   fine structure (XANES/EXAFS) spectroscopic methods. The contents of Cu
   (1,100-1,400 mg/kg) and Zn (500-700 mg/kg) dry weight were high in
   oyster soft tissue samples. The XANES/EXAFS results revealed that Cu and
   Zn existed primarily as copper (II) oxide (Cue) and zinc oxide (ZnO) in
   contaminated oysters. Furthermore, Cu and Zn formed clusters with Cu-O
   and Zn-O interatomic distances of 1.97 and 2.21 angstrom, (coordination
   numbers 1.0 and 5.6), respectively. In non-contaminated oysters, the
   less abundant Cu and Zn existed mainly as copper(l) sulfide (Cu2S) and
   zinc sulfide (ZnS) forming clusters with Cu-S and Zn-S (thiolates) bond
   distances of 2.09 and 1.23 angstrom (coordination numbers of 4.6 and
   2.4). These results provide further understanding on the chemical
   speciation of Cu and Zn in contaminated and non-contaminated oyster soft
   tissues as well as the bio-accumulation of trace metals in the oyster
   soft tissues. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Heavy metals and some organic substances which are drained into the
   aquatic environments and cannot be decomposed or eliminated will sink
   into sediments or find their way into different levels of food chain.
   Bioaccumulation is the process of continuous deposition and aggregation
   of these substances into the body tissue of living organisms. Mollusks
   are remarkably appropriate to be used as bio-indicators because of their
   motionless or almost sessile nature, relatively high abundance,
   selective absorption of certain ions, and worldwide distribution in
   marine and inland aquatic habitats. Chiton lamyi is a sedentary species
   from the phylum, Polyplacophora, which is usually abundant on the rocky
   shores and intertidal zone of marine environments. Sediment and Chiton
   samples were taken from four stations of Chabahar Bay in autumn 2013.
   After acid digestion of samples, the concentration of heavy metals
   (mercury, cadmium, arsenic, nickel, lead and copper) were measured by
   the graphite furnace atomic absorption apparatus, and the
   bioaccumulation factor in relation to sediment was calculated. The
   highest concentration value was calculated as 3.28 for cadmium in the
   Hafte Tir station. The results of this study indicated that chitons can
   be used as an appropriate bio-indicator for heavy metals particularly
   cadmium pollution in the marine environment.},

Abstract = {Concentrations of cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), lead (Pb) and nickel (Ni)
   were determined in the soft tissue of the oyster Pinctada radiata from
   three coastal stations during March-June 1990 and March-June 1992. In
   the 1990 samples, mean metal concentrations in oysters from different
   sampling stations varied between 0.77 and 1.93 mu g g(-1) for Cd, 0.38
   and 2.29 mu g g(-1) for Cu, 0.44 and 0.64 mu g g(-1) for Pb and 0.96 and
   1.33 mu g g(-1) for Ni, In the 1992 samples, the mean concentrations
   varied between 1.85 and 3.16 mu g g(-1) 1.01 and 1.18 mu g g(-1), 10.68
   and 18.66 mu g g(-1), and 0.94 and 1.33 mu g g(-1) for Cd, Cu, Pb and
   Ni, respectively, The 1992 samples appeared to have significantly (p <
   0.01 by Students' t-test) higher mean concentrations of Pb, Cd and Cu
   than the 1990 samples, except Cu in the 1992 samples, from one station
   which showed a significantly (p < 0.01 by Students' t-test) lower mean
   concentration. The difference in patterns of metal occurrence and the
   significant increase in the Pb, Cd and Cu mean concentrations in the
   1992 oyster samples may be due to a contribution from the 1991 Gulf War
   oil spill.},

Abstract = {This paper presents results of trace metal monitoring in the coastal
   waters of the eastern Adriatic (Croatian coast), during the 2001-2005
   period, using the Mediterranean blue mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis)
   as indicator species. Levels of essential (Cu, Zn) and non-essential
   (Cd, Cr, THg, Pb) metals were determined in a whole soft tissue of
   mussels collected from 20 locations along the eastern Adriatic coast.
   Examination of the spatial pattern of contaminants revealed two types of
   metal distribution. Lead, chromium, copper, zinc and total mercury were
   significantly elevated in the urban and industrial areas. Concentrations
   of Cr and Cd were more uniformly distributed across all sites. Elevated
   concentrations of Cd were also found in mussels from rural areas located
   far away from known anthropogenic sources of contamination. Although
   elevated concentrations of all trace metals were recorded in the areas
   with high input of industrial, harbor and urban wastes, the obtained
   data provide no proof of the significant pollution along the eastern
   Adriatic coast. Analysis of temporal trends showed that metal
   concentrations had not changed with time during the monitoring period.
   With few exceptions, 98\% of values were well below the permissible
   limits for fresh seafood.},

Title = {Human health risk associated with heavy metals from consumption of
   Asiatic Clam, <i>Corbicula fluminea</i>, from Laguna de Bay, Philippines},

Abstract = {Laguna de Bay, the largest and nationally significant freshwater lake
   ecosystem in the Philippines, has been increasingly subjected to
   anthropogenic pressures over the years. Domestic, agricultural, and
   industrial activities in the surrounding areas have contributed directly
   and indirectly to the deterioration of the lake's overall ecological
   health and integrity. This study assessed the chromium (Cr), nickel
   (Ni), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd)
   contamination in Asiatic clam, Corbicula fluminea, using quadrupole
   inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Estimated daily
   consumption of Asiatic clam was determined through a social survey. The
   data from analytical analysis and social surveys were utilized to
   calculate the target hazard quotient (THQ) to determine the potential
   health risks of consuming heavy metal-enriched clams to fishing
   households. Results from the Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices (KAP)
   survey indicated that the majority of the respondents have an acceptable
   level of knowledge on the hazards posed by the intake of contaminated
   clams but disapproved the banning of its collection and consumption.
   Sampled households with high consumption rates in all municipalities
   except Victoria were also found to be exposed to imminent health risk
   due to the high toxicity level of As based on their THQ values. Overall,
   one-third of the fishing households exposed to elevated health risk
   based on their total target hazard quotient (TTHQ) values already
   warrant a concern. The potential human health risks validate the
   worsening condition of Laguna de Bay. Integrative and holistic
   management of the lake through collaborative efforts of various
   stakeholders and institutions is necessary, to restore the health of the
   ecosystem and safeguard the health of the public.},

   the mussels breeding is one of the most important commercial activities.
   A survey on the classified sea farms in Campania was conducted, and it
   allowed us to identify and monitor the main areas of breeding. The
   results of the monitoring plan showed a heterogeneous distribution of
   these contaminants depending on areas with a general major contamination
   at shores located near strongly urbanized and industrial areas, in some
   cases abandoned. The heavy metal (lead, cadmium, chromium and mercury)
   levels were always below the maximum limits assessed by the EC, and all
   samples were compliants also for the 11 PAHs studied, although a maximum
   level was assessed by EC for the only benzo{[}a]pyrene. Finally, an
   evaluation of non-compliances for non dioxin-like PCB (ndl-PCB) levels
   was not possible because of the missing of a specific regulation,
   although only low levels were found.},

Abstract = {Metal contamination in seafood has raised public health concerns,
   especially for local residents who live in coastal areas. In this study,
   the levels of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and zinc (Zn) were
   determined in the marine bivalve, Marcia optima, as well as in water,
   and sediment samples collected from the coastal area of Phuket Bay,
   Thailand. The results showed that metal concentrations in sediments
   (4.05-7.14, 16.68-18.13, 164-213mgkg(-1) for Cd, Pb, and Zn,
   respectively) and water samples (0.16-0.44, 0.15-0.26, and
   0.32-0.48mgL(-1) for Cd, Pb, and Zn, respectively) were below the
   threshold effects concentration of the sediment quality guidelines for
   adverse effects to occur and the marine water quality standards of
   Thailand. A human risk assessment was performed and the results showed
   that the risks associated with M. optima consumption at Saphan Hin and
   Paklok were negligible for most of the metals studied, with the maximum
   estimated daily intake value being observed for Zn (0.00663mgkg(-1) per
   day) at Saphan Hin. In addition, Cd, Zn, Pb, and Hg would be unlikely to
   pose a risk to human health with a hazard quotient of less than 1, with
   only the bioaccumulation factor of Zn being detectable in both locations
   (0.034 and 0.026 at Saphan Hin and Paklok, respectively). However,
   continuous monitoring is encouraged to prevent the risks associated with
   the consumption of metal-contaminated seafood.},

Abstract = {As a natural lagoon, rich in biological resources including fish, crabs,
   and bivalves, Da-Peng Bay Lagoon receives the discharges from the
   neighboring rivers, Kao-ping, Dong-gang, and Lin-Bian, which have harmed
   the ecology and reduced the water quality of the lagoon. This study
   analyzes seasonal variation of heavy metals concentration (As, Cd, Cr,
   Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in the muscle and viscera of the green-lipped
   mussel Perna viridis from Da-Peng Bay Lagoon. Data from this study may
   provide information on the use of Perna viridis as a bioindicator for
   heavy metals pollution in the lagoon. The heavy metals concentrations
   were greater in viscera than in muscles of the green-lipped mussel Perna
   viridis. Results showed that the mussel is capable of accumulating high
   contents of Cu and Zn. Generally, the order of concentrations in the
   muscle by season was Zn > Cu > Cr or As. In viscera, the general order
   of concentrations was Zn > Cu > Pb or Cr or As. Mercury was not detected
   in winter and spring in muscle and viscera. Cadmium displayed
   significant variation with season. There was also significant
   correlation between tissue concentration and heavy metals, including Cu,
   Pb, Zn, Ni, Cd, and As.},

   relationship with the content of heavy metals in their tissue, in three
   beaches of the Caribbean coast of Colombia. The results showed the study
   populations were different in terms of morphological characteristics and
   density (Berrugas-Sucre < Cartagena-Bolivar < Riohacha-Guajira), but not
   in sexual proportion; although density was clearly related to beach
   occupancy by tourists. Analysis of metals revealed tissue concentrations
   varied depending on the location (Greater means: Hg = 0.018 +/- 0.004 in
   Riohacha; Pb = 0.110 +/- 0.060 in Berrugas and Cd = 0.040 +/- 0.010 A mu
   g/g in Cartagena). No relationships were found between morphometric
   variables and heavy metals content. Principal components analysis
   highlighted Riohacha for presenting differences respecting to Bocagrande
   and Berrugas in terms of physicochemical water parameters such as pH,
   temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and conductivity. Results
   suggest tourism rather than environmental pollution could be a sensitive
   factor for biota survival in Caribbean beaches.},

Abstract = {Contaminants compounds like Heavy Metals and Polycyclic Aromatic
   Hydrocarbons (PAH's) are primarily sourced from industrial and urban
   areas. As pollutants, these chemical elements and compounds are
   potentially toxic and present the capacity to negatively impact the
   ecosystem, especially the most sensitive ones such as estuaries.
   Bivalves' species have been successfully utilized as monitoring tools to
   evaluate pollutants bioaccessibility around the globe. The present study
   assessed heavy metals (Zn, Cd, Ni, Fe, Cr, Cu and Pb), As and PAH's
   levels in two mollusk species (Perna perna and Crassostrea rhizophorae)
   from Santos Estuarine System, in Sao Paulo State, in order to compare
   the effectiveness of each species in the biomonitoring process.
   According to the obtained data, Perna perna mussels may be better
   indicators of environmental pollution than Crassostrea rhizophorae
   oysters for some metals (Iron and Nickel) and hydrocarbons. On the other
   hand, in the present study, oysters had a higher capacity for retaining
   zinc, copper, and cadmium, due to their peculiar physiological
   characteristics.},

Abstract = {Concentrations of five heavy metals (Hg, Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn) were
   determined in tissues of wild mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis)
   collected at 41 stations located on the Spanish Atlantic and Northern
   coasts to assess the levels and spatial distribution of metals in the
   environment. This study, performed in 2005, constituted a contribution
   to the last international OSPAR pollution monitoring survey. A pool of
   mussel soft tissue was prepared using 50 or more individuals,
   representing the size range present at the sampling points.
   Quantification was carried out after a nitric acid digestion by atomic
   absorption spectrometry, AAS (Cd and Pb by electrothermal AAS; Cu and Zn
   by flame AAS; and total mercury by the cold vapour technique). The
   quality of the chemical analyses was assessed by interlaboratory
   exercises carried out on a regular basis. In general, the levels of the
   metals were higher for the Northern region than for the Atlantic one
   (except for a sampling site close to Vigo, one of the main Galician
   industrial areas). Some Galician sampling points (Atlantic coast, NW of
   Spain) located far from human inputs showed high Cd concentrations,
   which were attributed to the annual upwelling processes in this region.
   The levels of Cu increased from Northwest to East, whereas Zn
   concentrations were very homogeneous throughout the two studied
   geographical regions. These results were confirmed using multivariate
   studies (PCA and cluster analysis), as well as international `background
   assessment concentrations' criteria. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {CONTRIBUTION TO THE ECOTOXICOLOGICAL STUDY OF CADMIUM, LEAD, COPPER AND

Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {1986},
Volume = {90},

Abstract = {The understanding of natural fluctuations of metal concentrations in
   mussels used as bio-indicators is indispensable for a good assessment of
   the disturbances due to pollution. We have studied thoroughly the
   factors which condition bioaccumulation by using controlled populations
   of mussels, Mytilus edulis L., sampled monthly over more than two years
   (March 1982-May 1984) in the Bay of Bourgneuf, France. Seasonal changes
   in metal levels have been recognized, maximum values being observed in
   winter and early spring and minimum in later spring and summer.
   Depending on metal and size group, the ratios between these maximum and
   minimum values varied between 1.56 and 3.43. The fluctuations in
   soft-tissue weight appear to be the main explanatory factor of seasonal
   variations in metal concentrations in mussels. Fluctuations in metal
   levels related to size of mussels were observed. Except for cadmium in
   mussels with a mean dry weight of soft tissues > 0.2 g, a slight
   decrease in metal concentrations was observed for growing individuals:
   the regression coefficent b was -0.10, -0.11, -0.13 and -0.27 for Cd,
   Cu, Zn and Pb, respectively. The metals examined were rather uniformly
   distributed among the different groups of organs (visceral mass, gills
   and palps, ``remainder{''}) and, consequently, several analyses of
   metals in different organs do not provide much more information than one
   analysis on the whole soft tissue. It is concluded that fluctuations
   related to size or season are reflected by only moderate differences in
   the maximum and minimum concentrations of metals in the mussels, but
   that they are nevertheless sufficient to conceal low chronic or
   short-term pollution, except at those sites where the ``normal{''}
   environmental conditions are well-documented.},

Abstract = {The mussel, Brachidontes variabilis, and the limpet, Patella sp., were
   used as indicators to monitor cadmium, lead and mercury concentrations
   along the Lebanese coast. Studies were carried out in order to define
   the best strategy for assessing and minimizing the effects of size and
   physiological condition on the metal contents of the molluscs, and
   corrective models were constructed. Metal concentrations in surface
   water were measured to estimate bioconcentration factors (BCFs). The
   BCFs varied from 8.3 x 10(3) to 3.4 x 10(4), from 7.5 x 10(3) to 8.0 X
   10(3) and from 3.0 x 10(4) to 3.2 x 10(4), for Cd, Pb and Hg,
   respectively. For limpets, BCFs varied from 1.7 x 10(4) to 7.4 x 10(4)
   for Cd, from 2.5 x 10(3) to 6 x 103 for Pb and remained fairly constant
   at around 104 for Hg. The highest BCFs were associated with lowest
   contamination levels. The results of the geographical survey exhibited a
   similar large-scale spatial pattern for the two species and followed the
   metal concentration distributions measured in the waters. (c) 2005

Abstract = {The concentration of Cd, Cr and Pb in the following species Ameghinomya
   antique, Aulacomya atra and Mytilus chilensis, bivalves from Iloca,
   Constitucion and Pelluhue, coastal towns located in the Maule Region,
   Chile was determined. Representative tissue samples of each species were
   analysed by using atomic absorption spectroscopy with flame. Validation
   of methodology was carried out using a certified reference material
   (TORT-1). The ranges of concentrations found for Cd. Cr and Pb in the 3
   species were, respectively, 0.21-4.32, 0.38-12.62 and 0.43-31.10 mg
   kg(-1) dry weight. In relation to the results obtained and the average
   of each individual metal in the different species of bivalves, Pb
   concentrations were found in higher levels rather than those of other
   metals reported by other authors in a similar work, this element
   constitutes a potential health hazard for the consumers of shellfish.
   The results were statistically evaluated for possible correlations in
   the content of metals in different species and in different sites of
   origin. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The concentrations of lead, cadmium, copper, zinc, iron, and mercury in
   the water, sediment and biota of the Singapore River were determined. 
   The concentration of the various metals in water showed significant
   variation at different sampling times and there was enrichment of lead
   content.  The spatial patterns of metal distribution in the sediment
   could be due to the different pollution sources such as exhaust emission
   from boats and other environmental variables such as clay content of
   sediment or tide level.  In the biota, higher amounts of metals were
   found in species inhabiting the river bed while organisms of higher
   trophic level such as free-swimming fishes and crabs accumulated lower
   amounts.  In general, the flesh of fishes and crabs had the least
   content of metals compared to other tissues.  The concentration of
   various metals in bivalve, Mytilopsis sallei, which were found
   extensively in the river did not reflect the pollution distribution.},

Abstract = {Kastela Bay, located on the central part of east Adriatic coast, is
   heavily contaminated by mercury. The main source of contamination was a
   chlor-alkali plant, which was operating for 40 years since 1949.
   Previous studies showed that mercury concentrated in the sediment close
   to the plant is being dispersed throughout the bay by remobilization
   processes. Subsequent remobilization of mercury buried in the sediment
   may be harmful to various marine organisms. In order to assess the
   availability of remobilised mercury to marine organisms and to assess
   the health risk of consumption of shellfish species from the bay, a
   monitoring programme was initiated in September 1997. One thousand six
   hundred specimens of mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) of the same
   size and age, collected in a very clean area, were transferred to four
   stations in the bay 1.5 m above the sea bottom. Every month during the
   summer period and every second month in the winter period, 50 mussels
   were taken from each station for the analysis of mercury and
   monomethylmercury (MeHg) content. The results obtained during 1 year of
   biomonitoring suggest that the equilibrium concentration in transplanted
   mussels was established in a relative short period of time. The
   digestive gland is preferential organ for the accumulation of total
   mercury. Seasonal variation of mercury content both in the whole soft
   tissue, and organs (gills and digestive gland) was observed at all
   stations. However, methyl mercury is more concentrated in soft tissues
   than in digestive gland and gills, despite the fact that it is absorbed
   through these organs. The mercury levels in tissues were below accepted
   limits for human consumption. Obtained results showed that the
   implantation of mussels in an area containing sediment contaminated by
   mercury may be a good monitoring tool for the assessment of the
   availability of remobilised mercury to marine organisms. (C) 2000

Title = {Heavy Metals Bioaccumulation in <i>Mytilus galloprovincialis</i> and
   <i>Tapes decussatus</i> from Faro Lake (Messina), Italy},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL TRACE ELEMENT RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 2},
Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential bioaccumulation of
   arsenic (As), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and
   mercury (Hg) in the haemolymph and corpus of Mytilus galloprovincialis
   and Tapes decussatus from Lake Faro. The lake is particularly prone to
   the accumulation of substances that are potentially toxic to aquatic
   organisms, due to the input of pollutants from urban and agricultural
   sources and the low rate of water exchange. The combination of saltwater
   from the Tyrrhenian Sea, the Strait of Messina and freshwater from hilly
   aquifers has created brackish conditions in the lake, resulting in an
   area of high commercial shellfish productivity. As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn
   were determined using a single quadrupole inductively coupled plasma
   mass spectrometer; Hg was determined using a direct mercury analyser
   (DMA-80). Physicochemical parameters of the water from Lake Faro were
   also performed. Statistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad
   Prism 9.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., Boston, MA, USA) and Shapiro-Wilk
   normality was applied. Concentrations of Cd, Hg and Pb below the
   permitted MRLs in Mytilus galloprovincialis and Tapes decussatus used as
   `'biological indicators'' show that Lake Faro is not at risk of
   contamination by these pollutants and, moreover, is free of health
   problems for the consumer based on regulatory limits.},

Title = {Spatial variation of trace metals within intertidal beds of native
   mussels (<i>Mytilus edulis</i>) and non-native Pacific oysters
   (<i>Crassostrea gigas</i>): implications for the food web?},

Abstract = {Pollution is of increasing concern within coastal regions and the
   prevalence of invasive species is also rising. Yet the impact of
   invasive species on the distribution and potential trophic transfer of
   metals has rarely been examined. Within European intertidal areas, the
   non-native Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is becoming established,
   forming reefs and displacing beds of the native blue mussel (Mytilus
   edulis). The main hypothesis tested is that the spatial pattern of metal
   accumulation within intertidal habitats will change should the abundance
   and distribution of C. gigas continue to increase. A comparative
   analysis of trace metal content (cadmium, lead, copper and zinc) in both
   species was carried out at four shores in south-east England. Metal
   concentrations in bivalve and sediment samples were determined after
   acid digestion by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission
   spectrometry. Although results showed variation in the quantities of
   zinc, copper and lead (mg m(-2)) in the two bivalve species, differences
   in shell thickness are also likely to influence the feeding behaviour of
   predators and intake of metals. The availability and potential for
   trophic transfer of metals within the coastal food web, should Pacific
   oysters transform intertidal habitats, is discussed.},

Title = {Potential risks of heavy metals in green mussels (Perna viridis)
   harvested from Cilincing and Kamal Muara, Jakarta Bay, Indonesia to
   human health},

Abstract = {This study investigates Pb, Cd, and Cr in the suspended particulate
   matter (SPM), sediments, and green mussels from Cilincing and Kamal
   Muara, Jakarta Bay and estimates their potential human health risks. The
   results showed that the metal levels in SPM from Cilincing ranged from
   0.81 to 1.69 mg/kg for Pb and 2.14 to 5.31 mg/ kg for Cr, while in Kamal
   Muara ranged from 0.70 to 3.82 mg/kg for Pb and 1.88 to 4.78 mg/kg dry
   weight for Cr. The levels of Pb, Cd, and Cr in sediments from Cilincing
   ranged from 16.53 to 32.51 mg/kg, 0.91 to 2.52 mg/ kg; and 0.62 to 1.0
   mg/kg whereas in Kamal Muara ranged from 8.74 to 8.81 mg/kg; 0.51 to
   1.79 mg/kg, and 0.27 to 0.31 mg/kg dry weight, respectively. The levels
   of Cd and Cr of green mussels in Cilincing ranged from 0.014 to 0.75
   mg/kg and 0.003 to 0.11 mg/kg; while in Kamal Muara ranged from 0.015 to
   0.073 mg/kg and 0.01 to 0.04 mg/kg wet weight, respectively. Pb was not
   detected in all samples of green mussels. The Pb, Cd, and Cr levels in
   the green mussels were still below the permissible limits set by
   international standards. However, the Target Hazard Quotient (THQ) for
   adult and children in several samples were higher than one indicating
   po-tential noncarcinogenic effects to consumers due to Cd accumulation.
   To reduce the detrimental effects of metals, we suggest maximum mussel
   consumption of 0.65 kg for adults and 0.19 kg for children in a week
   based on the highest level of metals.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine heavy metal content (As, Cd, Cu,
   Hg, Cd, Pb, and Zn) in oysters transplanted in Ebro Delta bays (Alfacs
   and Fangar) where oysters are traditionally cultured for human
   consumption. Metal body burdens were monitored weekly during the period
   of maximal agriculture activity from May to June in 2008 and 2009.
   Results indicate that regardless of the high levels of metals reported
   in biota living in Ebro River, metal levels in oysters from both bays
   were similar to those found in unpolluted areas and far below the
   maximum limits of tolerance recommended by the European Commission.
   Nevertheless, metal accumulation patterns in oysters differentiate two
   sources of pollution: one coming from agriculture activities within the
   Ebro's delta for As, Cd, Cu, and Zn and other coming from Ebro River
   probably related to industrial activities upstream (Hg, Pb) or to lead
   shot pellets form hunting activities (Pb). Reported results, thus, are
   in concern with previous studies and indicate that metallic pollutants
   do not affect oysters cultures in Ebro Delta associated bays.},

Abstract = {Jakarta Bay has become contaminated by both organic and inorganic
   pollutants, including heavy metals. This study aimed to examine the
   effect of heavy metal pollution on green mussels cultured in Muara Kamal
   Waters, Jakarta Bay over seven months. In this research, the water
   quality was assessed, through measuring the concentrations of the heavy
   metals, Hg, Pb, Cd, Cr, and Sn in the water, and in the tissue of green
   mussels that had been cultured there for seven months. The percentage of
   congenital abnormalities (malformations) in the green mussels was
   analyzed descriptively and the relationship between the water quality,
   heavy metals, and green mussel malformation was studied through
   principal component analysis (PCA). The result showed that the heavy
   metals concentrations in the water and sediment exceeded the quality
   standard at Muara Kamal but that in other respects the water quality was
   quite good. The green mussels cultured there for seven months had
   accumulated high concentrations of heavy metals, and +/- 60\% of them
   had malformations of their shells. Based on the heavy metal
   concentrations in their bodies, the main cause of malformations in green
   mussels was suspected to be Pb, Hg, and Sn. However, the result of PCA
   showed it was the interaction between nitrogen compounds, phosphate,
   turbidity, salinity, pH, as well as the heavy metals in the water that
   determined the green mussel abnormality.},

Abstract = {The anthropogenic contamination of water bodies with metals via
   fertilizer, industrial sewage and urban wastewater has resulted in
   widespread problems in aquatic organisms, but also poses a risk to
   consumer health. Shellfish from coastal and estuarine environments
   bioaccumulate toxic metals in their tissues due to their ability to
   concentrate inorganic contaminants several orders of magnitude above
   ambient levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of
   trace elements in adult specimens of indigenous clams (Ruditapes
   decussatus). To this end, wild clams were collected from four different
   brackish areas of Sardinia (Western Mediterranean Sea, Italy) devoted to
   extensive aquacultural practices. The concentration of 16 trace elements
   (Al, Ag, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, Sn, Tl and Zn) in
   the tissues of the clams was quantified. The legal limits set by
   European Regulations for cadmium; mercury and lead were never exceeded.
   However, unexpectedly high values for aluminium and iron (mean 207 mg
   kg(-1) and 113 mg kg(-1) wet weight) were found in Santa Gilla lagoon,
   which is close to industrial settlements and had the highest values for
   the majority of chemical elements investigated. The highest values of
   the metalloid arsenic (As) were reported in the Porto Pozzo and San
   Teodoro lagoons (9.6 and 6.8 mg kg(-1) w.w., respectively). The clam R.
   decussatus confirmed the capacity of bivalves as suitable bioindicators
   of trace elements pollution. Further investigations are necessary for
   constant monitoring of clams, 32 which constitute an important
   traditional resource for the fishing activity in Sardinia. (C) 2018

Abstract = {This study analyzes the concentrations and variations of Cu, Mn, Zn, Al,
   Cd, Ag, As and Se among different size classes of Modiolus capax, from
   Punta Estrella, Bahia de las Angeles and Santa Rosalia in the Gulf of
   California, and of Modiolus modiolus and Mytilus californianus, from
   Bahia Tortugas in the Pacific. During November 1988, mussels of these
   species were collected and 45 organisms were selected (three replicates
   of 15 organisms each). Their biometric variables were measured: large
   size (88-98 mm), medium size (70-87 mm) and small size (56-66 mm). The
   reference standards and procedural blanks were analyzed for each group
   of 15 samples. The results indicate that the geographic distribution and
   accumulation of metals in the different sizes are mainly influenced by
   the sources of input, bioavailability in each place and the biological
   condition of the organisms. The mussels presented Cu levels independent
   of size in the region, except at Santa Rosalia. Zn, Cd and Se showed
   strong regional variability, but no clear trend with respect to the size
   of the organisms. Al showed high regional variability and a tendency to
   accumulate in small organisms; As and Se presented higher concentrations
   in the large to medium mussels, regardless of the sampling site. Mn
   tended to accumulate in large and medium mussels and was dependent on
   the sampling site. In Bahia Tortugas, M. californianus accumulates Cu,
   Mn and Cd at a rate three times lower than M. modiolus at the same level
   of exposure. Within the Gulf of California, the geographic distribution
   of Mn, Al and Zn was similar, with higher concentrations in the northern
   part. This is probably because the mussels are exposed to these metals
   through the sedimentary material resuspended in the Colorado River
   Delta. Cd presented levels of 70 and 27 mu g g(-1) at Bahia Tortugas and
   Bahia de las Angeles, respectively; both sites are exposed to coastal
   upwelling. Cu presented relatively low levels (<35 mu g g(-1)), except
   at Santa Rosalia (89 mu g g(-1)), where Cu is mined. As, Se and Ag
   presented low variability in the study area, with low levels that
   reflect natural levels at the sites studied.},

Abstract = {The present study is an attempt to assess the heavy metal contamination
   in the marine environment of the Arabian Gulf of Saudi Arabia. The
   concentrations of heavy metals in water and the soft tissues of the
   bivalve species Meretrix meretrix Linnaeus, 1758, from different
   stations along the Arabian Gulf coastline, were determined during the
   summer season of 2008. Bioaccumulation of some heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Cu,
   and Zn) in fresh parts of the clam (M. meretrix) was measured by an
   atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The average concentrations of heavy
   metals in the clam tissues were 0.224-0.908, 0.294-2.496, 3.528-8.196,
   and 12.864-24.56 mg/kg wet weight for Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn, respectively.
   In water, the mean concentration values of these metals were arranged in
   the following descending order: Pb > Cu > Zn > Cd. The heavy metal
   concentrations in tissues of M. meretrix were within the acceptable
   standards set by the US Environmental Protection Agency, the Commission
   Europ,enne, and the Food and Drug Administration of the USA. From the
   human public health point of view, these results seem to show no
   possibility of acute toxicities of Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn if the edible clam
   is consumed. It is recommended that relevant authorities should carry
   out a continual assessment on the levels of these pollutants in the
   studied area.},

Abstract = {Seasonal variations of heavy metals in integrated poly-cultured scallops
   and seawater from Ailian Bay, northern China were analyzed to reveal the
   potential factor in bioaccumulation of metals in scallop Chlamys
   farreri. Results showed that heavy metals (Cu, Zn, As, Cd, Cr, Pb and
   Hg) in seawater were much below the maximum permissible limits and
   showed no seasonal changes, but were consistent with the growing period
   of the poly-cultivated kelp. The content of Zn in scallop tissues was
   highest with an average value of 88.35 +/- 11.50 mg/ kg, and Hg content
   was lowest (0.046 +/- 0.025 mg/kg). The accumulation of Cu, As, Cd and
   Hg in scallops presented a significant seasonal change, and they were
   closely correlated with the physicochemical quality instead of heavy
   metals in seawater. Cadmium provided 88.9 \% of the total hazard index
   for adults and 72.2 \% for children. Arsenic should also be paid more
   attention in the risk assessment of human health.},

Abstract = {The present work provides the first results in heavy metal
   bioaccumulation in the autochthonous mussel Brachidontes rodriguezii
   from the Bahia Blanca Estuary (Argentina), one of the most important
   coastal environments of South America, subjected to different
   anthropogenic pressure. The study is based on the detection of Cd, Cu,
   Pb, Mn, and Fe in mussels' soft tissue and sediments' fine fraction by
   means of inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy
   (ICP-OES), in order to analyze the potential relationship between both
   components of the aquatic system. Additionally, different indices are
   calculated with the purpose of obtaining detailed data. The heavy metal
   burden in mussels varied seasonally, showing a clearer pattern for the
   stations located in the internal area of the estuary. Metals exhibited
   maximum values in summer and to a lesser extent in winter, followed by a
   decrease during spring. Multiple international guideline assessment
   allowed classifying the area as moderately polluted, including a low
   range for Cd and medium for Cu and Pb. Moreover, the average detected
   levels were within the measured ranges in other coastal areas. Regarding
   human health, trace metal content in mussels met the national and
   international standards for safe consumption.},

Title = {Relationship between copper speciation in sediments and bioaccumulation
   by marine bivalves of Taiwan},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {91},

Pages = {35-39},
Abstract = {This paper evaluates the relationships between copper species in
   sediments and accumulation by the purple clam (Hiatula diphos) and venus
   clam (Gomphina aeguilatera) collected from the field and culture
   (aquaculture) ponds in the polluted coastal area of Lukang, Taiwan.
   Sediment was sampled along with the molluscs, including oysters
   (Crassostrea gigas), purple clams (Hiatula diphos), rock-shells (Thais
   clavigera), venus clams (Gomphina aeguilatera), and hard clams (Meretrix
   lusoria), from two unique environments of Lukang during the period from
   August 1993 to July 1994.
   The data indicate that the total copper concentrations in sediments from
   culture ponds (185 mu g g(-1)) was higher than those of the field (44.0
   mu g g(-1)). Copper species in sediments were analyzed by a sequential
   leaching technique. Results show that concentrations of various copper
   species in the sediments are in the range of 1.14 +/- 0.59 to 13.2 +/-
   22.4 mu g g(-1) and 0.36 +/- 0.24 to 133 +/- 36.7 mu g g(-1) for the two
   environments, respectively. Also the exchangeable copper in sediment
   from culture ponds was 15 times higher than that from the field. In
   addition, the sum of exchangeable and copper carbonates had the highest
   percentages of copper in both the pond sediment (86.6 \%) and the field
   sediment (50.7 \%).
   Maximum copper concentrations (309 +/- 35.1 mu g g(-1)) in oysters were
   much higher than those in the other benthic organisms by about 4-127
   times. Similarly, the data also showed that copper concentrations in
   Thais clavigera were 12-32 times higher than those in other benthic
   organisms. Copper concentrations in various benthic organisms differed
   significantly (p < 0.05) from that in Thais clavigera. This capacity
   makes Thais clavigera a potential candidate for monitoring copper in
   marine sediments. In terms of copper species, the best correlation was
   generally obtained between copper carbonates in sediments and copper
   concentrations in Hiatula diphos (r = 0.886{*}). A strong multiple
   regression correlation (p < 0.05, r(2) = 0.7894) also indicates that the
   copper carbonates may dominate as the available form of copper to
   Hiatula diphos from various environments in the Lukang coastal area
   under natural physicochemical conditions.},

Abstract = {The occurrence of 21 trace elements in native Mediterranean mussel
   (Mytilus galloprovincialis) from the Calich Lagoon, a typical brackish
   area of the northwest of Sardinia (Italy), was investigated. The
   seasonal variation of metals in bivalves was considered, and the highest
   values were found in spring and summer; in particular, a high
   significant (P < 0.001) temporal variation was reported for silver (Ag)
   and mercury (Hg). The highest and similar concentrations were registered
   for aluminium (Al, mean 32 mg kg(-1)wet weight), iron (Fe, mean 32 mg
   kg(-1) w. w.), and zinc (Zn, mean 25 mg kg(-1) w. w.). The maximum
   limits set by European Regulations for cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and
   lead (Pb) were never exceeded. Speciation analysis revealed negligible
   risk related to inorganic arsenic (iAs). Therefore, M. galloprovincialis
   confirmed its role as suitable bioindicator to monitor the contamination
   of coastal environments. Although the recommended tolerable weekly
   intake (TWI) was not exceeded, the levels of aluminium should be
   carefully evaluated in monitoring plans in the studied lagoon.},

Title = {Biomonitoring of heavy metals and trace organics using the intertidal

Abstract = {This paper presents the results of a 6-year (1998-2003) survey of trace
   toxics in the intertidal mussel Perna viridis conducted by the Hong Kong
   Environmental Protection Department. Concentrations of heavy metals and
   trace organics were measured in the soft bodies of P. viridis collected
   from five sites in Hong Kong waters, i.e. Wu Kai Sha (Tolo Harbour), Ma
   Wan (Northwest), Tsim Sha Tsui (Victoria Harbour), Tai Tam (Hong Kong
   South) and Lamma Island (Southern Waters) in order to establish the
   spatial patterns of contaminants in mussels. Among the metals analysed,
   Cd showed a significant concentration gradient in Hong Kong waters. The
   levels of Cd in P. viridis were significantly higher at Ma Wan as
   compared to the other sites studied. Ma Wan also had relatively higher
   concentrations of Pb. Mn concentrations were particularly prominent at
   Wu Kai Sha. Significantly higher concentrations of Hg and Cu were
   recorded at Tai Tam and Tsim Sha Tsui. Tai Tam and Wit Kai Sha had
   higher levels of V; whereas higher Ni concentrations were recorded at
   Lamma Island and Tai Tam. No clear spatial patterns for Al, As, Cr, Fe
   and Zn were observed.
   Higher concentrations of PAHs in P. viridis were observed around urban
   centres impacted by sewage discharges (e.g. Tsim Sha Tsui); whereas
   higher PCB levels were found not only in Tsim Sha Tsui but also in less
   urbanised areas such as Lamma Island and Tai Tam, suggesting that these
   may be due to non-sewage related inputs. The study also shows that
   Northwest and Southern waters are subject to a higher degree of DDT
   pollution compared with other sites. Of the 17 dioxin compounds
   analysed, positive data were mostly recorded for two compounds which are
   of low toxicity (i.e. OCDD and I,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDD) whereas the most
   toxic congeners (i.e. 2,3,7,.8-TCDD and 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD) were not
   detected in the 6 years of monitoring. In general, the levels of OCDD in
   P. viridis were found to be higher in Tai Tam and Lamma Island in
   Southern Waters of Hong Kong.
   This study found that the levels of some highly toxic heavy metals (i.e.
   Cd, Hg and Pb) in the mussel P. viridis did not exceed the recommended
   limits for shellfish as food in Hong Kong (i.e. Cd: 2.0 ppm; Hg: 0.5
   ppm; Pb: 6.0 ppm wet weight). The levels of As and Ni in P. viridis were
   also well below the action limits set by the US FDA (i.e. As: 86 ppm;
   Ni: 80 ppm wet weight). DDT and PCB contaminations in P. viridis were
   below the concentrations of concern. Compared with data obtained in the
   1980s, the current levels of DDTs in P. viridis were 4-16 times lower;
   whereas Pb concentrations recorded in Tsim Sha Tsui have also been
   lowered significantly. This is mainly related to reduction in local and
   regional pollution sources in the past 20 years. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The concentrations of six trace metals, cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu),
   chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn) and mercury (Hg) were determined in
   the soft tissues of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and bottom
   sediments collected from the coastal area of Boka Kotorska Bay
   (Montenegrin coast). The mussels and sediment samples were collected at
   three sites along the Boka Kotorska Bay from the autumn of 2014 to the
   winter of 2016. The concentrations (mg/kg dw) of these metals in the
   mussel samples ranged from 1.01 to 2.87 for Cd, 6.08 to 13.2 for Cu,
   1.37 to 3.55 for Pb, 85.6 to 241 for Zn, 0.72 to 4.05 for Cr and 0.098
   to 0.269 for Hg. The concentrations (mg/kg dw) of these metals in the
   sediment samples ranged from 0.16 to 0.39 for Cd, 4.32 to 48.2 for Cu,
   7.02 to 49.8 for Pb, 22.0 to 158 for Zn, 93.1 to 317 for Cr and 0.035 to
   0.497 for Hg. The metal content in the mussel samples and the metal
   content in the sediment collected from three locations over four
   different seasons were analyzed using the Pearson correlation
   coefficient (r) and cluster analysis (CA). A correlation between the
   metal levels found in the mussel soft tissues with those found in the
   sediments, for both 2014 and 2015, were established. The metal pollution
   indexes (MPI) for the sediment and mussels were compared, indicating
   that the most polluted sediment was at the location Institute of Marine
   Biology Kotor (IBMK) and the most polluted mussels were sampled from the
   Zanjice location.},

Abstract = {Seasonal variations in the concentrations of four trace heavy metals
   (cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn)) were determined in
   Donax trunculus (Mollusca, Bivalvia) at two contaminated sites in the
   gulf of Annaba (East of Algeria): El Battah and Sidi Salem. The average
   concentrations of the metals exhibited the following order: Zn>Cu>Pb>Cd
   for the two sites. The statistical analysis revealed a significant
   effect of seasons for all metals measured, the highest values being
   recorded in winter for Zn and in summer for the other metals. Contrary
   to expectation, both sites were contaminated with trace heavy metals
   analysed. Although the highest levels were detected in Sidi Salem beach,
   there was no significant difference on trace heavy metal concentrations
   between sites, except for Cd. The implication of this metal
   contamination for local population was discussed.},

Abstract = {Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) were sampled from artificial
   substrates deployed from May 30 to October 19, 1995, at 19 locks and
   dams from Minneapolis, MN, to Muscatine, IA. Analyses of composite
   tissue samples of zebra mussels (10-20-mm length) revealed accumulation
   of mercury(Hg), cadmium (Cd), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
   during a 143-d exposure period. Concentrations of total Hg ranged from
   2.6 to 6.1 ng/g wet weight and methylmercury (CH3Hg) from 1.0 to 3.3
   ng/g wet weight. About 50\% (range 30-70\%) of the mean total Hg in
   zebra mussels was CH3Hg. Cadmium ranged from 76 to 213 ng/g wet weight.
   Concentrations of total PCBs (Aroclor 1254) in zebra mussels varied
   longitudinally (range 1000-7330 ng/g lipid weight), but the composition
   of PCB congeners (total of 21 measured) was similar throughout the
   river. Chlordane and dieldrin were the only two pesticides detected of
   the 15 analyzed. Zebra mussels are sentinels of contaminant
   bioavailability in the Upper Mississippi River and may be an important
   link in the trophic transfer of contaminants in the river because of
   their increasing importance in the diets of certain fish and waterfowl.},

Abstract = {In the framework of the biomonitoring programme of the Gulf of Annaba
   (north-eastern Algeria), this study aims to assess the health status of
   the Gulf by transplanting the brown mussel Perna perna (Linnaeus 1758)
   for 12 weeks (June 2017-August 2017) at three sites. The concentrations
   of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) and as well as a
   battery of enzymatic and non-enzymatic biomarkers were measured in
   mussels before and after the transplantation period. Furthermore,
   analysis of trace metals was performed on the surface layer of the
   sediment of all the sites. A significant increase in the Cu and Pb
   concentrations in the mussel dry tissues was observed after the
   transplantation period and followed the order of metal contamination of
   the surface layer sediments, indicating a relationship between the
   bioaccumulation of metals and their bioavailability at each site. Unlike
   those of Cu and Pb, Cd and Zn concentrations did not reach significant
   levels of bioaccumulation at any of the three study sites. The biomarker
   response results were complementary to the measured metal concentrations
   in the mussel tissues and were associated with the metal accumulation
   index. Metal bioaccumulation in mussels and supporting biomarker
   response results identified the most important pollution point sources
   in the area.},

Abstract = {Native mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis are used as bioindicator
   organisms to assess the concentration levels and toxic effects of
   persistent chemicals, polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs), and heavy metals using biomarker responses, such as
   catalase (CAT), glutathione s-transferase (GST), and condition indices,
   for the Algerian coast. The results show that mussels of Oran Harbour
   are extremely polluted by PCBs and PAHs, i.e., 97.6 and 2892.1 mu g/kg
   d.w., respectively. Other sites present low levels of pollution.
   Furthermore, high concentrations of zinc, lead and cadmium are found in
   mussels from fishing, agricultural and estuarine sites, respectively,
   while low concentrations of copper are found in all of the sites
   studied. CAT activity is negatively correlated with Cd and Cu, and Zn is
   positively correlated with GST and CAT. Site classification tools reveal
   the potential toxicity of coastal areas exposed to anthropogenic
   pressure and a gradient of toxicity along the Algerian west coast. (C)

Abstract = {Faro Lake is a coastal meromictic lagoon with singular characteristics
   in the Mediterranean (Messina, Sicily - Italy). It is part of the
   Natural Oriented Reserve of Capo Peloro (38 degrees 15 57 N; 15 degrees
   37 50 E). In this area, traditional mollusc farming activity persists,
   producing autochthonous' mussels. This study reports of the Mytilus
   galloprovincialis haemolymph chemical profile and water variables
   determination of 1 year-lasted survey (April 2016 - March 2017). The
   determinations of electrolytes (Na+, Cl-, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, P inorganic)
   and heavy metals in both Faro lake water and haemolymph have been
   carried out. Heavy metals are elements with high density and are quite
   toxic in low concentrations, such as Aluminum (Al), Arsenic (As), Cobalt
   (Co), Chrome (Cr), Copper (Cu), Iron (Fe), Magnesium (Mg), Manganese
   (Mn), Lead (Pb), Tin (Sn), Zinc (Zn). Heavy metals toxicity depends,
   principally, on bioaccumulation processes. M. galloprovincialis is a
   good bio-indicator, ideal for assess levels of environmental pollution
   thanks to its biological, ecological and physiological characteristics.
   The results of this study showed a typical fluctuation range in
   haemolymph and water parameters, related to the water ones;
   chemical-physical parameters affected the ions (electrolytes and metals)
   levels in some period of the year. The study reports the interactions
   between biotic (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and abiotic (water
   parameters) components of Faro Lake, and creates reference data for
   further future study on the same area or on similar ones.},

Abstract = {The understanding of the bioaccumulation phenomenon of heavy metals in
   the living substance is of an extreme complexity. This is due to the
   interpenetration of several parameters which influence this
   bioaccumulation such as: the physico-chemical characteristics of the
   study area, the chemical properties of the contaminant and the biologic
   factors of the organism. This work constitutes, using Mytilus edulis as
   bioindicator, a contribution to study the metal contamination at
   different points of the mouth of Sebou's estuary. The samples were
   collected during the spring and the summer of the year 2005. The
   obtained results reveal a contamination of the study area by all the
   measured metals especially by lead, cadmium and chromium. This study
   allowed also discerning the existence of a variation in the accumulation
   of heavy metals according to Mytilus edulis size, as it was reported in
   the literature. Indeed, it showed that the small mussels accumulate
   heavy metals more than the big, mainly for manganese, chromium and
   cadmium. Seven trace metals (Mn, Cu, Cr, Pb, Co, Fe and Cd) were
   detected in the four studied organs (hepatopancreas, gills, gonads and
   muscle); the variations was least or more significant according to the
   organ. So, we conclude that the bioaccumulation does not make in a
   strictly selective way.},

Title = {Zinc in fish, crabs, oysters, and mangrove flora and fauna from
   Cleveland Bay},

Abstract = {Zinc in muscle tissue from 28 species of fish, three species of sharks
   and rays, two species of squid and cuttlefish, and three species of
   crustacea collected from Cleveland Bay, together with some measurements
   made on oysters and mangrove flora and fauna are reported, In the fish
   species the mean Zn concentration in muscle tissue was 4.83+/-2.82 mug/g
   wet weight, slightly lower than zinc measurements (7 mug/g wet weight)
   made in 14 fish species collected from the bay in 1975, Zinc in sharks
   and rays ranged from 3.5 to 7.2 mug/g wet wt, in squid and cuttlefish
   13-16 mug/g wet wt, and in crustacea levels ranged from 14 to 18 mug/g
   wet wt. Zinc levels in fish varied between species with concentrations
   well below the ANZECC Maximum Residue Limit of zinc in seafood (150
   mug/g wet wt), Although lower zinc concentrations were found in oysters
   collected from the Townsville Harbour area (2080 mug/g wet wt), compared
   with previous measurements made 25 years ago at this site, these levels
   are still above the Maximum Residue Limit for zinc in oysters (1000
   mug/g wet wt). Concentrations of zinc in oysters from Orpheus Island
   (2547 mug/g wet wt), about 74 km away from industrial and urban
   activity, are also above the safe guideline values. Horseshoe Bay
   oysters transplanted to Ross Creek accumulated zinc at a rate of about
   100 mug/g of oyster tissue per week, suggesting that dissolved zinc
   levels at this site are elevated, and that oysters rapidly accumulate
   zinc, Highest concentrations of zinc in mangrove leaves (30-65 mug/g dry
   wt) occurred in Osbornia octodonta, Exocaria agalocha, and Aegialitus
   annulata, compared with Ceriops tagal, and Avicennia marina (5-10 mug/g
   dry wt). No significant difference in zinc concentration occurred
   between leaves and litter fall for most of these species, with the sole
   exception of Exocaria, which showed almost a twofold increase in
   concentration. In seven species of mangrove fauna levels of zinc were
   very uniform and close to 50 mug/g (dry wt) Telescopium telescopium from
   the mouth of the Ross Estuary was the exception with levels at 400 mug/g
   (dry wt). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Zebra mussels have invaded many lakes in the United States and could be
   a useful tool for monitoring responses of aquatic biota to changes in
   mercury loading. The goal of the present study was to evaluate zebra
   mussels for use as a biomonitor of mercury contamination by comparing
   zebra mussel mercury concentrations between a lake with only indirect
   atmospheric mercury contamination (Otisco Lake, NY, USA) and a lake that
   was directly contaminated by mercury discharges (Onondaga Lake, NY,
   USA). Zebra mussels were sampled in both the spring and fall of 2004 and
   2005. Total mercury (THg) concentrations in zebra mussels were
   approximately seven times greater in Onondaga Lake than in Otisco Lake,
   and water column mercury concentrations differed by an order of
   magnitude between the two lakes. Seasonal differences resulted in
   significantly higher zebra mussel THg concentrations during the fall for
   both lakes. There was also significant variation among different
   sampling sites in Onondaga Lake. Mussel methylmercury concentrations
   averaged 53\% of THg concentrations but were highly variable. Strong
   relationships between water column THg and zebra mussel THg suggest that
   zebra mussels are a good indicator of aquatic mercury concentrations and
   could be used as an effective biomonitor of mercury contamination in
   aquatic ecosystems. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2013;32:638643. (c) 2012

Abstract = {The current study aimed to examine how some gastropods absorbed trace
   metals (Chicoreus ramosus and Hemifusus pugilinus). The existence of 17
   elements, including aluminium, arsenic, boron, calcium, cadmium, cobalt,
   chromium, copper, iron, potassium, lithium, manganese, sodium, nickel,
   phosphorus, lead, and zinc (Al, As, B, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Li,
   Mn, Na, Ni, P, Pb, and Zn), was confirmed by inductively coupled
   plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) analysis of trace metals. According to
   the ICP-MS results, C. ramosus (Al: 1.97 +/- 0.2 mu g/g, Fe: 1.93 +/-
   0.2 mu g/g, and As: 1.52 +/- 0.4 mu g/g) and H. pugilinus (Al: 1.85 +/-
   0.7 mu g/g, Fe: 1.68 +/- 0.6 mu g/g, and As: 1.37 +/- 0.6 mu g/g) both
   had significant amounts of aluminium, iron, and arsenic, respectively.
   Zinc concentrations of 0.58 to 0.7 mu g/g (C. ramosus) and 0.67 to 0.2
   mu g/g were recorded (H. pugilinus). The elemental composition of the
   surface of the sample was confirmed by scanning electron
   microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) micrographs,
   which also showed the degree of trace metal absorption in the chosen
   gastropod species.},

Title = {Heavy metal(loid)s in multiple media within a mussel mariculture area of
   Shangchuan Island, China: Partition, transfer and health risks},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {211},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Limited research has been conducted on the heavy metal (loid) (HM)
   exchanges among seawater, sediments and cultured mussels in mariculture
   areas. To determine the impacts of mussel mariculture on the transfer
   and risks of HMs in coastal environments, samples of seawater, sediments
   and cultured mussels from a typical mariculture area in the South China
   Sea were analysed. The logarithmic partition coefficients of
   sediment/water indicated that HMs were preferentially retained by
   sediments. There were relatively low ecological risks in mussel raft
   mariculture areas. Principal component analysis and correlation analysis
   revealed the influences of terrestrial input and ocean circulation on
   the HMs in seawater, and the bioaccumulation factors reflected the
   possible accumulation of HMs in seawater by cultured mussels. Mussel
   farming was the indirect source of HMs in sediments, and the biochemical
   processes of cultured mussels promoted the transfer and accumulation of
   HMs into sediments. Health risk assessment revealed that children were
   more susceptible than adults, and Cd, As and Cr were among the
   threatening elements. Nonetheless, the health risks that were possibly
   caused by the daily consumption of farmed mussels were still within safe
   limits. Thus, the potential pollution remediation and biomonitoring
   functions of mussel aquaculture in coastal water environments will be
   further studied in the future.},

Abstract = {A historical Cd pollution of the Lot-Garonne River system (France) has
   led to the contamination of sediment and water of the Gironde Estuary.
   in spite of the decrease of fluvial Cd inputs since the early 90ies, Cd
   concentrations in the Gironde oysters remain higher than European norms
   (5 mug.g(-1) dry mass) and the ``zone D{''} classification of the
   estuary prohibits bivalve production and harvesting for human
   consumption, A geochemical survey in salt marshes used for aquaculture
   (crustaceans) has been conducted in order to assess the heavy metal
   contamination level in these systems periodically alimented by the
   Gironde water, accompanied by caging experiments on three bivalve
   species of economical interest: oysters (Crassostrea gigas), cockles
   (Cerastoderma edule) and clams (Ruditapes philippinarum) to study heavy
   metal accumulation in these organisms. Distribution of heavy metals in
   this system is controlled by biogeochemical processes and is independent
   of routine water management. Contamination levels in the studied species
   indicate the high accumulation of Cd by oysters. On the other hand, Cd
   concentrations in benthic species, such as cockles and clams, are
   clearly lower than European safety limits for human consumption.},

Title = {Study of heavy metal bioaccumulation in <i>Mytilus galloprovincialis</i>

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY \& INNOVATION},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Marine pollutants such as heavy metals are well-known due to their
   bioaccumulative nature, toxicity and persistence in the marine
   environment. The present research aims to evaluate the bioaccumulation
   of three metals (Cd, Zn and Cu), individual mean (multimetal)
   bioaccumulation index (IMBI) and metal pollution index (MPI) as an
   assessment tool in Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincis), based
   on the full factorial central composite face centered (CCF) design.
   Mussels were exposed to different sub-lethal concentrations
   (0-10\%-72h-LC50 -72h-mg.L-1) of studied heavy metals for three days. At
   the end of exposure cycle, the bioaccumulations of heavy metals content
   in mussels were determined. Multiple regressions were used to fit
   experimental data to a second-order polynomial equation, which was then
   examined using variance analysis (ANOVA). The results revealed that the
   indexes IMBI and MPI depend on the type and concentration of metals and
   also on the metals combination. Accordingly, the toxicological
   metal-metal interactions were found not linear meaning supra-additive
   (synergistic), infra-additive (antagonistic) or no/zero interaction. The
   optimization of experimental data was used to determine the optimal
   conditions for the heavy metal bioaccumulation. It was demonstrated that
   the CCF design combined with the concept of quantitative bioindicators
   can be used as appropriate tool in ecotoxicological evaluation and
   prediction of metals bioaccumulation. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published

Abstract = {This paper presents the results of a seasonal survey of heavy metals
   accumulated in sediments and in the soft parts of the body of the mussel
   Perna perna at four stations in the Gulf of Annaba (Algeria). Pooled
   soft tissues from 10 mussels representing the entire range of sizes were
   digested in nitric acid. Statistical analysis reveals a significant
   seasonal effect on all the measured metals, the highest values being
   recorded in winter. With the exception of Cr, the levels for all metals
   were significantly higher in the east, at the outlet of the Seybouse
   River, than at all other monitoring stations. The study also shows that
   north-western waters are subject to a significantly lower degree of
   heavy metal pollution than elsewhere in the gulf. Levels were
   nevertheless within the limits of public health standards. The results
   confirm the usefulness of P. perna as a bioindicator for heavy metal
   pollution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Evaluation of the Potential of the Hard Clam (<i>Meretrix meretrix</i>)
   Shell Which Can Be Used as the Bioindicator for Heavy Metal Accumulation},

Abstract = {Clams, Meretrix meretrix, were one of the favorite aquatic products in
   Taiwan and the world. It was reported that the water pollutants such as
   heavy metals and chemicals might accumulate in the clam body and shell
   through filter-feeding behavior. Thus, the bivalves could be used as
   bioindicators in the aquatic environment. The present study analyzed 20
   trace elements, Mg, Sr, Li, Cd, Ba, Mn, Al, U, Ti, Pb, Nd, B, S, Zn, Fe,
   P, Na, K, Cu, and Ni, in the shells of the clams collected from the wild
   coastal area and cultured ponds to evaluate which elements have the
   potential to be biomarkers. The concentrations of 20 elements were
   detected by Solution-Based Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry
   (SB-ICPMS). Among them, Cd, Al, U, Ti, Nd, S, and K were below the
   detection limit. The remaining elements were analyzed for accumulation.
   The levels of Zn, Fe, and Ni possess high variation in an identical
   environment; so, a PCA was conducted without these three elements to
   reduce noise. The PCA result proved that the clam could absorb specific
   trace elements from the habitat. After a period of time, the contents of
   the absorption in the shells of the clams living in an identical
   environment became more similar. The analyzed element, Pb, was not found
   with a special difference in this study. The levels of Na, Sr, Mg, B,
   Mn, P, Ba, Li, and Cu reflected different sampling sites, which
   suggested that these elements in the species M. meretrix had the
   potential to be used as biomarkers for assessing heavy metal
   accumulation in the environment.},

Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {1976},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-80},
Abstract = {Concentrations of Zn, Cd, Pb and Cu were determined in whole soft parts
   of M. edulis sampled in Port Phillip Bay and Western Port Bay, Victoria,
   Australia. The mussels were sampled according to procedures suggested by
   previous studies to eliminate the effects of natural environmental
   variables. Results of the analytical studies were compared to data on
   the quantities of trace metals discharged by industry into the
   catchments of each bay. This allowed an evaluation of the indicator
   ability of the mussel without the need for multiple analyses of water
   samples. The mussel apparently can act as an efficient time-integrated
   indicator of Zn, Cd and Pb over a wide variety of environmental
   conditions. Although additional variables may remain to be investigated,
   the mussel is recommended as an alternative to the analysis of water and
   sediments. With further development this organism may also be useful for
   monitoring industrial effluent characteristics at the discharge site,
   allowing rapid, reliable and inexpensive control of water quality. The
   mussel is of doubtful use as an indicator of Cu; other indicator types
   such as macroalgae may be better-suited to the study of this element.},

Abstract = {The assessment of environmental pollution of the coastal areas of the
   Malaysian Peninsula was done by analyzing the contents of the heavy and
   trace elements in the bivalves blood clams (Anadara granosa) and green
   mussels (Perna viridis) and sediments at twenty-two sampling stations to
   look for prevailing trends. Heavy and trace elements analyzed in this
   study were As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Se and Zn. Two techniques, namely the
   neutron activation analysis (NAA) and atomic absorption
   spectrophotometry (AAS) were used in the quantitative determination of
   the heavy metals while Marine Sediment Reference Material (BCSS) and
   Lobster Hepatopancreas (TORT-1) provided the certified reference

Abstract = {Metal concentrations in oyster, Crassostrea gigas, were investigated
   using 155 samples collected seasonally during 1996-2001 from the Chi-ku,
   Tai-shi, and Tapeng Bay areas in southwestern Taiwan. Seasonal
   variations as well as site difference were identified in the metal
   concentrations. The metal concentrations of oyster in southwestern
   Taiwan indicated a typical seasonal pattern of ``winter-spring
   maximum{''} and ``summer minimum{''}. Among the three sites, Zn, Cu and
   Cd contents were found to be the highest in the March sample from
   Tai-shi, whereas Hg level was found to be the highest in the January
   sample from Chi-ku. The overall mean concentrations of Zn, Cu, Cd and Hg
   sampled from the three sites were 860 +/- 375, 267 +/- 193. 0.954 +/-
   0.484 and 0.097 +/- 0.056 mg/kg dry wt., respectively, representing the
   baseline metal concentrations of oyster in Taiwan. In comparison with
   the 1970's survey, except the 1.8-fold increase in Cu, the other three
   elements were within the same ranges. After the transformation of the
   dry-weight-base data into flesh-weight-base data based on a ratio of 6.8
   to 1, the mean metal levels. for the most part, closely agreed with many
   international food standards. However, extraordinarily high level of Cu
   (1115 mg/kg dry wt.) in oyster were found occasionally in wintertime.
   Therefore, it is strongly suggested that regulations with respect to
   food safety standards of metal concentrations need to be established as
   soon as possible.},

Abstract = {In the present work, both seawater and limpets (Patella vulgata L.) were
   collected from different sampling points in the Vigo estuary area
   (Galicia, NW Spain) and their heavy metal concentrations (Zn, Cd, Pb,
   Cu) were determined by means of a voltammetric technique. The results
   showed a direct relationship between the heavy metal levels in seawater
   and the content in biological samples, especially those obtained from
   limpet soft tissues, directly related to the increasing importance of
   anthropogenic environmental contamination. Heavy metal concentrations
   were usually higher in soft tissues than in shell, with a maximum
   difference corresponding to Cd and Zn (average of 93.6 and 86 folds,
   respectively). As expected, heavy metal content was higher in animal
   samples situated in inner part of the estuary zone, except for cadmium
   content in soft tissues, where a maximum of 5.62 ppm was quantified in
   limpet soft tissues collected next to the open sea area. Statistical
   analysis allowed the establishment of a clear relationship between Zn
   and Cd content in both shells and soft tissues from limpet, and
   especially between Zn and Cu in soft tissues (p < 0.001).},

Abstract = {The suitability of using four bivalve molluscs (Sanguinolaria acuminata,
   Anadara granosa, Meretrix meretrix, and Pelecyora trigona) in
   biomonitoring of heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Cd, Zn, and Hg) collected from
   intertidal regions of the Sunderban mangrove wetland, northeastern part
   of the Bay of Bengal, were evaluated. Both speciesdependent variability
   and temporal variations were pronounced. A high degree of organ
   specificity was evident in the bivalves where gill and mantle exhibited
   higher metal accumulation due to ion exchange property of the mucous
   layer covering these organs while shells represent very poor
   accumulation. Elevated values of Zn and Cu reflect high potential for
   biomagnification through marine food chain. Metal concentrations in
   different body size groups of the bivalves do not follow uniform trend.
   Correlation coefficient between different metal couplings as tested
   statistically revealed significant coupling for Pb-Zn, Pb-Cu, Zn-Cu, and
   Hg-Cu. Concentrations of all the metals in specific organs (visceral
   mass, mantle and gill) of the bivalves exceeded the safe levels
   according to the international standards for metals compiled by Food and
   Agricultural Organization of the United Nations and would be of great
   risk for human consumption. It is concluded that the mussel and clam are
   suitable biomonitors to employ in programs designed to assess changes in
   metal pollution in the Sunderban mangrove wetland.},

Abstract = {The accumulation of toxic and persistent substances in the environment
   continuously increases owing to antropogenic activities. Particular
   attention is being paid to the presence of heavy metals, because of
   their irreversible effects on man.(1) In fact such elements tend to
   concentrate in all aquatic environment matrices(2,3): sediment and
   biota, and for this reason they are present in the aquatic food chain,
   becoming dangerous for humans too, as a consequence of the consumption
   of marine products. The present communication suggests an analytical
   procedure for the spectroscopic(4) determination of heavy metals (Hg,
   Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn, Cr, Ni, Co, Mn,Fe and Al) in mussels and clams, showing
   that a correct purging procedure considerably reduces the metal content
   in these matrices.
   The elements were determined employing Flame Atomic Absorption
   Spectroscopy (FAAS) in the case of Mn, Fe and Al, Graphite Furnace
   Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (GFAAS) with the L'vov platform in the
   case of Zn, Pb, Cd and Cu, and without the L'vov platform in the case of
   Cr, Co and Ni. Mercury was determined by Cold Vapour Atomic Absorption
   Spectroscopy (CVAAS) in the recirculation mode, using stannous chloride
   as reducing agent.
   Mussels and clams were sampled in the Gore Bay (Province of Ferrara,
   Italy), an area devoted to the fishing and breeding of mussels and clams
   for food, but with considerable pollution problems due to its location
   in proximity of the mouth of the Po river, which is the principal
   carrier towards the sea of a large amount of industrial waste water.},

Journal = {RSC ADVANCES},

Volume = {5},

Pages = {40036-40045},
Abstract = {The multiple recognized mollusk species are usually regarded as one
   group lying at the second trophic level in the marine ecosystem. As a
   result, the virtual resolution of Hg uptake and transfer processes that
   occur in different mollusks would be overlooked. In this work, the
   concentrations of total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg), delta
   N-15, delta C-13 and lipid contents were comprehensively analyzed in 11
   mollusk species collected from the Chinese Bohai Sea during 2007-2012.
   The contents of THg and MeHg were in the range 27.2-461.1 and 2.1-295.5
   mu g kg(-1), respectively. The trophic levels (TLs) were in the range
   1.99-4.02. The biomagnification of Hg was evident from the significant
   positive correlations between Hg contents and TLs, and from the trophic
   magnification factors (TMFs). MeHg is the main species of Hg
   magnification in mollusks, while growth dilution occurs in the trophic
   transfer of inorganic mercury (IHg). TLs showed a greater effect on Hg
   levels in mollusks than lipid contents.},

Title = {Oyster-based national mapping of trace metals pollution in the Chinese
   coastal waters},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {224},
Pages = {658-669},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {To investigate the distribution and variability of trace metal pollution
   in the Chinese coastal waters, over 1000 adult oyster individuals were
   collected from 31 sites along the entire coastline, spanning from
   temperate to tropical regions (Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, East China Sea and
   South China Sea), between August and September 2015. Concentrations of
   macroelements {[}sodium (Na), potassium (IC), calcium (Ca), magnesium
   (Mg) and phosphorus (P)] and trace elements {[}cadmium (Cd), copper
   (Cu), zinc (Zn), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), silver (Ag), and
   titanium (Ti)] in these oysters were concurrently measured and analyzed.
   The results showed high Ti, Zn and Cu bioaccumulation in oysters from
   Guangdong (South China Sea) and Zhejiang (East China Sea). Oysters at
   Nanji Island (Wenzhou) and Daya Bay (Huizhou) accumulated significantly
   high concentrations of Ni and Cr. The elements in these oysters were
   several times higher than the national food safety limits of China. On
   the other hand, the present study found that normalization of metals by
   salinity (Na) and nutrient (P) could reflect more details of metal
   pollution in the oysters. Biomonitoring of metal pollution could benefit
   from incorporating the macroelement calibration instead of focusing only
   on the total metal concentrations. Overall, simultaneous measurement of
   macroelements and trace metals coupled with non-linear analysis provide
   a new perspective for revealing the underlying mechanism of trace metal
   bioavailability and bioaccumulation in marine organisms. (C) 2017

Abstract = {The Lagoon of Butrinti, is located in the south of Albania, and it
   represents an important ecological area that is known for its mussels
   farming. Heavy metals enter the lagoons through several pathways, mainly
   due to the pedo-geological processes as well as human activity. This
   study aims to quantify the origin, the spatial distribution and the
   level of pollution caused by heavy metals in soil, sediments, water and
   mussels of Butrinti lagoon. The soil samples were taken at two different
   locations in the proximity of the Butrinti lagoon. The water, sediments
   and mussels samples have been collected from seven selected sites during
   August 2011. The results showed that the concentration of Pb, Cu, and Cd
   in some of the samples in question was above the normal standards of the
   parameters for the respective soil, reflecting the impact of
   humanactivity while the high Cr content was spotted due to the natural
   climate and weather related process. The results also showed that Pb
   (SedS 4, 6, 7, EF=2.17-3.17), Cd (SedS 7, EF=1.47) and Cr (SedS7,
   EF=1.61) are enriched in the sediment. In addition the level of Pb (SS6)
   and Cr (SS6, SS7) in the underground water was above the standards
   defined by EU-2008. This study shows that concentrations of Cd in
   mussels over 0.3 mg kg(-1) are at a critical limit and need to be
   continuously monitored. This study suggests that the sources of this
   contamination are the anthropogenic input, previous agricultural
   activities, contributions of the tributaries, and direct impact from the
   activity in the urban area of Ksamil.},

Title = {Contamination by heavy metals (Cd, Zn, Cu, and Hg) of eight fish species
   in the Gironde estuary (France)},

Abstract = {The Gironde estuary, one of the largest in Europe, is considered as a
   reference ecological system, with all the western European diadromous
   fish species present. The national biomonitoring program on the coastal
   marine environment has revealed since 1979 severe metal pollution
   (mostly cadmium {[}Cd]) in oysters collected from the estuary. No data
   are available on metal contamination levels in fish, despite their
   ecological and economic importance. We present the results from a
   detailed study based on 4 metals (Cd, zinc {[}Zn], copper {[}Cu], and
   mercury {[}Hg]) measured in 4 organs (gills, dorsal skeletal muscle,
   liver, and kidneys) from 8 fish species illustrating several ecological
   combinations: European eel (Anguilla anguilla), twaite shad (Alosa
   fallax), bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), meagre (Argvrosomus regius),
   flounder (Platichthys flesus), thin-lipped grey mullet (Liza ramada),
   sole (Solea vulgaris), and Canary drum (Umbrina canariensis). The
   results show very marked differences between species and organs, as well
   as very significant variations between the 4 metals. Although metal
   concentrations measured in fish muscle are low, except in the case of Hg
   for the A. fallax, high levels of Cu and Cd were observed in the kidneys
   and livers of L. ramada and A. anguilla. A multifactorial analysis based
   on rank ordered metal concentrations for the 8 fish species clearly
   shows 4 clusters of species assigned to the different degrees of metal
   contamination, from the lowest contaminated (A. regius, D. labrax, S.
   vulgaris, and U. canariensis) to the most contaminated group (L.
   ramada). The most contaminated species (L. ramada, A. anguilla, and P.
   flesus) are characterized by long residence times in the estuary,
   between 3.5 and 14 yr. For L. ramada, biofilms with high metal storage
   capacities would be the principal uptake route; the two other species
   are benthic with a carnivorous regime. Comparisons between our data and
   four estuaries (Seine, France; Mersey, U.K; La Plata, Argentina;
   Guadalquivir, Spain), on a limited number of common species, metals and
   fish organs, clearly reveal higher Cd bioaccumulation levels in the
   Gironde estuary.},

Abstract = {The oyster Crassostrea rhizophorae is a bivalve abundant in Venezuelan
   estuaries and consumed by local populations. No known values have been
   reported on trace metals in oysters from the central Venezuelan coast.
   We report the concentrations of Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr,
   V and Zn in the soft parts of C. rhizophorae, which were collected
   bimonthly between March 2008 and March 2009, at two sampling areas from
   the Central Venezuelan Coast: Buche estuary and Mochima estuary. Our
   results show that for each metal there is a similar temporal variation
   pattern. The concentrations of the heavy metals reported in this work
   are useful as reliable baselines and can be used for comparison in
   future environment studies. Concentrations in C rhizophorae from the
   Buche estuary can be interpreted to be high on a global scale for Cd,
   Cu, Ni and Mn, indicating atypically raised bioavailabilities. (C) 2013

Abstract = {This study investigated the tissue-and species-specific bioaccumulation
   of heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Hg, Zn, As, Cd, and Pb) in three benthic
   bivalves (the ark shell, Scapharca subcrenata; the surf clam, Mactra
   veneriformis; and the Manila clam, Ruditapes philippinarum) collected
   from the coast of Laizhou Bay in the Bohai Sea. The results demonstrated
   that the visceral masses of the bivalves tended to accumulate heavy
   metals more efficiently than their muscles. The capacities of the
   bivalves to bioaccumulate metals followed a similar order: Cd > Hg > Zn
   = As > Cu > Cr = Pb. The conditions of metal contamination in the
   bivalves tended to be worse along the eastern coast than in other
   regions. Overall, the Manila clam was more severely contaminated by
   heavy metals than the surf clam and ark shell. Judging by the hazard
   quotients (HQ) of the metals in the muscles of the bivalves, the
   greatest hazard risk to human health comes primarily from As. (C) 2017

Abstract = {The marine mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis lives attached to the
   surface of hard substrata, where its exposure and relative immobility
   allow it to record changes in ambient seawater. It is also found along
   the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea. Oxygen and carbon isotopes were
   analysed for calcite and aragonite in separate shell layers, while
   major, minor and trace elements in the bulk shell were analysed to
   evaluate environmental conditions such as the temperature of carbonate
   deposition, freshwater influence and locations of anthropogenic
   pollution. We found that, on average, aragonite is enriched by 1.1 parts
   per thousand in 13C and by 0.2 parts per thousand in 18O compared with
   calcite. The calculated temperatures for M. galloprovincialis shell
   growth from the investigated area range from 13.4 to 20.9 degrees C for
   calcite and from 16.6 to 23.1 degrees C for aragonite. According to the
   18O and 13C values of shell layers, we can separate the investigated
   area into three locations: those with more influence of freshwater,
   those with less influence of freshwater and those with marine
   environments. The highest concentrations of manganese, barium, boron,
   arsenic, nickel and chromium were observed in shells from Omis, Bacvice
   and Zablace (Central Adriatic) and Sv. Ivan (South Adriatic), where
   chemical and heavy industries are located and where sewage is known to
   be discharged into coastal areas. The highest concentrations of zinc,
   lead and copper were measured in samples from Pula, Rijeka and Gruz,
   where there are also ports in addition to industry.},

Abstract = {Commercial marine organisms were collected from the coast of Xiangshan
   Bay to investigate the concentrations of eight heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr,
   Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and evaluate the potential health risks. The
   results indicated considerable variations in the heavy metal
   concentrations among six species groups, of them mollusks (seasnail,
   benthic bivalve, and oyster) generally contained relative high levels of
   most metals, followed by crustaceans (crab and shrimp), by contrast,
   fish had low concentrations of all metals, except Hg. Three heavy metal
   groups were identified to interpret the accumulative characteristics in
   the marine organisms. Spatial distributions illustrated the geographical
   variations of heavy metal concentrations in the sampling areas.
   Moreover, maricultured organisms demonstrated lower heavy metal
   concentrations than did the wild. Health risks of most heavy metals
   exposed from marine organism consumption were safe, except for As which
   is associated with the high target cancer risk values.},

Title = {Comparative studies on the biokinetics of Cd, Cr, and Zn in the green
   mussel <i>Perna viridis</i> and the Manila clam <i>Ruditapes
   philippinarum</i>},

Abstract = {A kinetic approach was employed to determine the rates of metal uptake
   (Cd, Cr and Zn) from the dissolved phase and the rate constants of metal
   depuration in the mussel Perna viridis and the clam Ruditapes
   philippinarum. The effects of ambient metal concentration, salinity, and
   body size on the metal influx rate were examined. A linear positive
   relationship was observed between the metal influx rate and the metal
   concentration in ambient seawater. There was some evidence that Zn
   uptake was regulated by the bivalves in response to an increase in
   ambient Zn concentration. The uptake rate constant was highest for Zn
   and lowest for Cr in both bivalves, and was higher in mussels than in
   clams. The metal influx rate decreased by 1.6-1.8 times for the three
   metals when the salinity was increased from 15 ppt to 30 ppt. However,
   the effect of salinity on Zn influx in mussels was not statistically
   significant. A negative relationship of Cd and Zn influx rates with
   tissue dry weight was also found in both bivalves. Cr uptake in mussels
   was not significantly correlated with body size, but its uptake in clams
   was significantly correlated with body size. Metal concentration in
   ambient seawater appeared to be the most determining factor on metal
   uptake from the dissolved phase in both bivalves. The efflux rate
   constants of the three metals were within the range of 0.01-0.03 d(-1),
   and were comparable between the mussels and the clams. Using a simple
   bioenergetic-based kinetic model, it was shown that both dissolved
   uptake and food ingestion can contribute to metal accumulation in the
   bivalves. However, Zn accumulation in the clam R. philippinarum was
   dominated by uptake from food ingestion. Metal partitioning in ingested
   food was found to be critical in affecting the relative importance of
   metal uptake from the dissolved phase and food source, primarily because
   of the large variability of this parameter in natural environments. (C)

Abstract = {Morocco is one of the most affected regions by heavy metal pollution
   worldwide. In this study, two ecosystems in Agadir Bay, southern
   Morocco, were studied seasonally, using surface sediment and bivalve
   species. The con-centrations of Cu, Pb and Cd were determined using the
   Shimadzu AAS 7000 flame atomic absorption spec-trophotometer method. Our
   results marked average levels corresponding to an unpolluted sediment
   with a low contamination degree, low ecological risk associated with
   metal contamination, and levels that did not exceed the thresholds set
   by EC, USEPA, INERIS and INRH, except for Pb in tourist beach. The
   principal component analysis findings revealed a positive correlation in
   the bioaccumulation between the two compartments, with an influence of
   abiotic parameters. Thus, to better manage environmental pollution in
   these ecosystems, authorities must implement waste treatment strategies
   in the surrounding harbor and tourist complexes and prohibit the use of
   these toxic metals in the coastal areas.},

Abstract = {The Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis (L.) was collected
   from the fall 2005 to the winter 2009 from the six sites on the
   Montenegrin coastline. Two wild samples were collected from the open sea
   coastline, and two cultivated and two wild were from the Boka Kotorska
   Bay. The mussels soft tissue was analyzed for zinc, copper, lead,
   cadmium, arsenic and total mercury. Concentrations of these metals, in
   mg kg(-1) dry weight, ranged from 135-210 for Zn, 6.2-14.5 for Cu,
   4.0-11.5 for Pb, 1.7-2.1 for Cd, 5.8-12.4 for As and 0.1-0.5 for Hg. The
   metals were found to be present in the samples at different levels, but
   not in concentrations higher than maximum residual levels prescribed by
   the European Union (EU) and US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA)
   regulations for seafood. This indicates that the consumption of wild or
   cultivated mussels from the studied area is safe in moderate quantities.},

Title = {Relationship between shell weight and cadmium content in whole digestive
   gland of the Japanese scallop <i>Patinopecten yessoensis</i> (Jay)},

Abstract = {Seasonal and age-specific variations of cadmium (Cd) concentration in
   the digestive gland were investigated in the Japanese scallop
   Patinopecten yessoensis from Peter the Great Bay, Sea of Japan, with
   different degrees of Cd pollution. The seasonal changes in Cd
   concentrations of the digestive gland were inversely proportional to the
   dry weight of the gland. Concentrations of Cd and total Cd content (mu g
   Cd per organ) increased with age (age-specific) to the same extent in
   contaminated and uncontaminated areas. There was also a strong positive
   correlation between Cd content in the whole digestive gland and shell
   weight and it is proposed that this relationship can be used as a new
   criterion for comparative evaluation of Cd levels in scallops from
   different areas We hypothesize that Cd is uptaken into scallops in
   proportion to the amount of calcium that absorbed through ion channels,
   and in addition, Cd in the digestive gland is in immobile forms (e.g.
   metal-rich granules) that accumulate with age. Moderate environmental
   pollution has no effect on the relationship between Cd content and shell
   size and the observed decrease in growth performance of the scallops
   from polluted areas may be due to other factors. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Within the framework of the MYTITURK project, heavy metals and organic
   compounds contaminations were assessed in transplanted mussels in eight
   different bays from the Eastern Aegean coast. Izmir Bay, Canakkale
   Strait entrance, Saros and Candarli Bay were defined low pollution
   extent according to Principal Component Analysis taking into metal
   accumulation. PAHs (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons) levels in the
   range of 29.4-64.2 ng g(-1) (dry weight) indicated that PAH
   contamination level classified as low along the Aegean coast.
   Concentrations of Aroclor 1254 and 1260 were higher in transplanted
   mussels from Canakkale Strait Outlet due to industrial activities was
   originated from Marmara Sea. The organochlorinated pesticides such as
   heptachlor (<0.4 ng g(-1)), aldrin (<0.30 ng g(-1)), dieldrin (<0.75 ng
   g(-1)), endrin (<2.3 ng g(-1)) concentrations were homogeneous however,
   HCB (Hexachlorobenzene) and lindane concentrations were found
   undetectable level along the coast. DDE/DDT ratio in the caged mussels
   form Gulluk and Gokova Bay indicated recent DDT (Dikloro difenil
   trikloroethan) usage in these areas. The residues of organochlorinated
   compounds in transplanted mussels confirm the long persistence of DDTs.
   According to world health authorities, the concentration of heavy metals
   in mussels for the study area can generally be considered not to be at
   levels posing a health risk except Zn. The levels of POPs indicated that
   transplanted mussels have a lack of risk for the human health. (C) 2013

Abstract = {Water quality surrounding the mussel farm of Mytilus edulis chilensis at
   Brown Bay (Beagle Channel) was evaluated. The levels of five heavy
   metals in sediment and in gill and digestive gland of mussels were
   examined to consider potential risks to human health. Cd showed the
   highest enrichment factor in relation to its level in Earth crust
   (3.85-21.58), which could be related to an upwelling phenomenon. A
   seasonal trend was found regarding metal bioaccumulation, being higher
   in winter than in summer. The bioaccumulation pattern in gill was Zn >
   Fe > Cu > Cd, meanwhile in digestive gland was Fe > Zn > Cu > Cd.
   Despite Pb was measured in sediment (15.59-23.91 mu g/g dw), it was not
   available for being incorporated by mussels. In all cases it was below
   the detection limit (2.37 mu g/g dw). With regard to human consumption
   of mussels from Brown Bay, none of the elements analyzed should cause
   concern for consumers. Values measured in tissue mussels were below the
   limit of 10 mu g/g dw for Cd and Pb established by SENASA for molluscs.
   Considering that studied mussels are for human consumption and the
   relatively high levels of metals in sediment may vary their availability
   if physical parameters changes, periodical monitoring must be carried
   out to avoid human risks and to produce food in a responsible manner
   that complies with the food safety standards. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {The concentration of (Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Pb, Zn) were analyzed in
   sediments, shells and tissues of the molluscs Meretrix meretrix,
   Crassostrea madrasensis and Cerithidea cingulata from two stations of
   Uppanar Estuary, southeast coast of India. The concentrations of the
   heavy metals analyzed exhibited variations in sediments, tissues and
   shells of the study animal from all the two stations. Zn and Cu
   concentration were below the alarming level. In the present study Mg
   content was found to be higher in shell and tissue. The Fe content was
   found to be higher in sediment in both the stations, but it was the
   second highest metal recorded in shell and tissue. Cd and Co was minimum
   accumulated of all the metals estimated in sediment and animal whereas
   Mg was recorded maximum (548.3 +/- 5) in C. cingulata shell. All the
   metals analysed were within the safety level. The combined correlation
   of both the stations between the sediment vs. sediment, tissue vs.
   tissue, shell vs. shell were positively correlated and significant at P
   < 0.001 and P < 0.05 level. In addition to continuous contribution of
   pollutants due to human activities, industries may have a significant
   contribution of these metals in all the stations. As suggested by many
   reported studies found in the literature, regular biomonitoring of heavy
   metal concentrations at these sites is needed since Meretrix meretrix,
   Crassostrea madrasensis are a popular commercial bivalve in India.},

Abstract = {With industrialization and human activities, shellfish may be
   contaminated by various pollutants such as heavy metals. This study aims
   at the concentrations of As, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Sn, Sb and Pb in
   shellfish collected from Fujian of China, and the risk of heavy metals
   in shellfish on human health based on target hazard quotients (THQ).
   Results showed that the THQ values of the elements were far below 1,
   except for As with an average value of 1.148 in razor clam. No
   detrimental health effects of heavy metals on humans health was observed
   by daily consumption of mussel and oyster, but the exposed population to
   short-necked clam, scallop and razor clam might experience
   noncarcinogenic health risks because each of the total THQ values was
   above 1 for the three shellfish.},

Abstract = {Mussels are worldwide recognized as pollution bioindicators and used ill
   Mussel Watch programs, because they accumulate pollutants in their
   tissues at elevated levels ill relation to pollutant biological
   availability in the marine environment. The present study deals with the
   use of Mytilus galloprovincialis as a local bioindicator of heavy metal
   and Cs-137 contamination in an estuarine ecosystem (Thermaikos gulf,
   Greece in Eastern Mediterranean). M. galloprovincialis samples were
   collected monthly from two aquaculture farms during the period April to
   October 2000. Analyses for the heavy metals Cu, Cr, Ni, Zn, Fe, Mn and
   Cs-137 showed that the concentrations measured were low and similar to
   those from other non-polluted Mediterranean areas. In terms of the two
   sampling stations, there were no statistically significant differences
   between them. On the contrary, the seasonal evolution of either heavy
   metals or Cs-137 levels presented high variation. The levels were found
   to increase during the cold period of the year, especially for Cu, Zn,
   Mn and Cr which are essential for life. Stable metals were positively
   inter-related and moreover, metals more involved in biochemical
   activities seem to present more correlations than others with less
   significant role in the metabolism of the organisms. (C) 2005 Elsevier

   mussel gills as the indicator tissue},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare the level of metal contamination in
   two bays in the middle part of the Eastern Adriatic coastal zone in
   Croatia using the gills of mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis as
   indicator tissue. Despite the existing sources of contamination,
   previous studies with caged mussels only indicated moderate metal
   contamination of the Katela Bay, contrary to the Trogir Bay in which
   marina and shipyard present a probable source of Cu- and
   Zn-contamination.
   The measurements of metallothioneins (MTs) and metals that induce MT
   synthesis (Cu, Zn, and Cd) were performed in the heat-treated gill
   cytosol and total proteins (TPs) in the untreated gill cytosol. MTs were
   determined by differential pulse voltammetry, Cu and Zn by flame atomic
   absorption spectrometry (AAS), Cd by graphite furnace AAS, and TPs by
   Bradford spectrophotometric procedure.
   The results collected in four sampling campaigns (autumn periods from
   2001 to 2004) indicated that MT levels in mussel gills (expressed on dry
   mass basis 2.3 +/- 0.3 mg g(-1)) were comparable with basal levels
   reported in the literature (2.5 +/- 0.8 mg g(-1)). Observed
   interindividual, temporal, and spatial MT variability could be
   associated with different confounding factors, such as the time of
   sampling, total protein concentration, and mussel size rather than
   cytosolic levels of Cu and Zn. Metal levels, expressed on wet mass
   basis, in the heat-treated gill cytosol ranged from 1.33 to 11.31 mu g
   g(-1) for Zn, from 0.72 to 2.96 mu g g(-1) for Cu, and from 0.036 to
   0.100 mu g g(-1) for Cd. The highest Zn level was measured at Vranjic
   (Katela Bay)-the site influenced by untreated domestic wastewater, while
   somewhat increased Zn and the highest Cu levels were found at marina and
   shipyard locations (Trogir Bay). The highest Cd level was measured at
   Inavinil (Katela Bay).
   The observed association of gill MT levels with several biotic and
   abiotic factors limits its use as the biomarker of low-level metal
   exposure. Therefore, the use of the metal concentrations in the
   heat-treated gill cytosol of Mediterranean mussels should be considered
   for the assessment of the low-level metal contamination of coastal
   marine areas.},

Abstract = {In the present work, metals (cadmium, lead, copper, nickel, tin,
   selenium, and mercury) have been estimated in the Ebro River (Spain)
   using the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) as an environmental
   bio-indicator. In two sequential studies, in 2006 and 2008,
   concentrations of metals were calculated in water as well as in the
   shells and fleshes of the zebra mussels. Samples were collected from
   assorted locations of the river. Metals were determined successfully at
   trace levels through voltamperometry, a sensitive technique. It has been
   noted that analysis of bioaccumulators like zebra mussels can be helpful
   in evaluating metal pollution in water.},

Title = {Metal pollution as a potential threat to shell strength and survival in
   marine bivalves},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {755},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Marine bivalve molluscs, such as scallops, mussels and oysters, are
   crucial components of coastal ecosystems, providing a range of ecosystem
   services, including a quarter of the world's seafood. Unfortunately,
   coastal marine areas often suffer from high levels of metals due to
   dumping and disturbance of contaminated material. We established that
   increased levels of metal pollution (zinc, copper and lead) in sediments
   near the Isle of Man, resulting from historical mining, strongly
   correlated with significant weakening of shell strength in king
   scallops, Pecten maximus. This weakness increased mortality during
   fishing and left individuals more exposed to predation. Comparative
   structural analysis revealed that shells from the contaminated area were
   thinner and exhibited a pronounced mineralisation disruption parallel to
   the shell surface within the foliated region of both the top and bottom
   valves. Our data suggest that these disruptions caused reduced fracture
   strength and hence increased mortality, even at subcritical
   contamination levels with respect to current international standards.
   This hitherto unreported effect is important since such non-apical
   responses rarely feed into environmental quality assessments, despite
   potentially significant implications for the survival of organisms
   exposed to contaminants. Hence our findings highlight the impact of
   metal pollution on shell mineralisation in bivalves and urge a
   reappraisal of currently accepted critical contamination levels. (C)

Abstract = {The aim of the present work is to broaden our knowledge on the
   variability of trace metals in mussel tissues, focusing on seasonal
   fluctuations in the three different sampling sites of Algerian west
   coast (Oran Harbor (Si), Ain Defla (S2) and Hadjaj (S3)). For this
   purpose, the bioavailability (metal indices) and bioaccumulation (metal
   concentrations in soft tissues) of heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Pb, and Cd),
   and the physiological characteristics (e.g. biological indices such as
   condition index (CI)) of mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis have been
   assessed and related to seasons and sites. In Si, the highest levels of
   metal concentrations and indices were obtained in mussels sampled in
   winter for Zn, Cu and Cd, but in summer for Pb. The biological indices
   significantly decreased in winter. In S2, the levels of concentrations
   and indices of all metals varied whatever the seasons, excepting in
   summer where the values were the lowest. In summer and spring, the
   biological indices were lower than in autumn and winter. The low growth
   of organisms in spring and summer might be correlated to the
   reproductive period and the low trophic level known in S2. S3,
   considered as a ``pristine{''} area, showed low metal concentrations and
   indices, and high biological indices, reflecting the favorable
   physiological conditions for the mussel growth. This approach might be
   used in the monitoring of the quality of coastal waters and the present
   work provided a useful data set for Mediterranean monitoring network.

Abstract = {Heavy metals (namely Cr, Cu, Zn, As, Hg, Pb, Ni, and Ag) that are
   present at concentrations common in ambient marine waters can cause
   adverse effects in shellfish. Such effects can significantly impact the
   trophic structure of a biological community. Heavy metals uptake is
   dependent on both geochemical and biological factors. In bivalves, the
   extent of accumulation is a function of several biotic and abiotic
   variables. Based on several criteria, (including: an ability to
   accumulate metals without suffering mortality, habitation within, and
   continuous exposure to, the contaminated matrix, hardiness, and ease of
   sampling) bivalve molluscs have proven to be useful biomonitors for a
   host of inorganic contaminants. it is essential that the biomonitoring
   plan is not only site specific, but that it considers the use of
   indigenous species whenever possible. This paper will provide a general
   review of studies that have employed bivalved shellfish as sentinel
   bioindicators in marine environments impacted by heavy metals, and give
   suggestions for conducting biomonitoring assays.},

Abstract = {Results of two years monitoring of heavy metals and arsenic
   concentrations in soft tissue of Mediterranean blue mussel Mytilus
   galloprovincialis are presented. Samples were taken at six localities
   (five exposed to various pollution Sources and one control site) on the
   east coast of the Middle Adriatic in October 2003 and 2004 and in April
   2004 and 2005. All measurements were carried out with source excited
   Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence Method (EDXRF). Measured
   concentrations were in the following ranges: Pb (2-7 mg/kg); As (4-30
   mg/kg); Cr (1-2.9 mg/kg); Mn (2-13 mg/kg); Fe (53.4-719 mg/kg); Ni
   (0.8-5 mg/kg); Cu (3.7-11.1 mg/kg) and Zn (59.1-273 mg/kg). Maximum
   values of the most elements were measured in samples from the most
   polluted Vranjic region. Statistically significant difference among six
   localities (p = 0.05) was found for As, Fe and Zn while Mn, Fe and Cu
   showed significantly higher concentrations in spring period. None of the
   selected elements showed significant difference between the control and
   exposed regions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A comprehensive environmental assessment of the Abu Zenima coast, Egypt,
   was done by evaluating the heavy metal pollutant levels in sediments,
   marine seashells, and seawater. Environmental parameters as the
   geoaccumulation index, contamination factor, enrichment factor, soil
   pollution index and potential ecological risk index proved that the
   study area was very severely enriched with Cd, severely enriched with
   Pb, and moderately enriched with Zn. However, these pollutant levels
   were still lower than some standardized reference values. Furthermore,
   the bioaccumulation index indicated that gastropod shells had greater
   ability to concentrate Fe, Cd, Ni and Zn than pelecypod shells, which
   may be attributable to the shape of the gastropod shell. Regarding the
   seawater samples, Pb, Cd, Cu, and Fe levels were higher than their
   average oceanic metal concentrations. Moreover, the average
   concentrations of heavy metals in the studied area, especially those of
   Pb, Cd, and Zn, were higher than those the coasts of Rosetta,
   Kazakhstan, Russia, southeast India, and the North Adriatic Sea. The
   main sources of these pollutants were anthropogenic sources such as
   gypsum and manganese factories, kaolin deposits, sewage, industrial
   wastes, urban runoff and irrigation.},

Abstract = {The intensity of heavy metals (Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cd, Co, Cu, Pb) were
   estimated in sediment, shell and tissue of the molluscs Cerithidea
   cingulata, Crassostrea madrasensis and Meretrix meretrix from two
   stations of Vellar Estuary, Southeast coast of India. The concentrations
   of the heavy metals analyzed exhibited variations in sediments, tissue
   and shell of the study animal from the 2 stations. Zn and Cu
   concentration were below the alarming level, whereas Mg (274.0 +/- 12)
   content was higher in shell and tissue. The Fe (416.6 +/- 1.7) content
   was higher in sediment in Station 1, but it was the second highest metal
   to be recorded in sediment, shell and tissue. To understand the
   background concentration the level of these metals were studied in the
   sediment. Cd and Co were minimum accumulated in all the metals estimated
   in sediment and animal whereas Mg was maximum in sediment. Similarly all
   the metals analysed were within the safety level. The combined
   correlation of both the stations between the sediment verses, sediment,
   tissue verses, tissue, shell verses. Shells were positively correlated
   and significant at P<0.001 and P <0.05 level. The result revealed that
   continuous input of pollutant due to human activities, industries might
   have a significant contribution of these metals in all the stations.},

Abstract = {The concentrations of heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Hg and As)
   in surface sediments and bivalve mollusks in Kaozhouyang Bay were
   investigated. A biological risk analysis of the sediments indicated that
   ten sites (about 76.92\% of the total number of sites) had a 21\%
   incidence probability of toxicity. A health risk analysis of the bivalve
   mollusks indicated that Cu and As posed low risks to consumer health. On
   the basis of the target hazard quotient (THQ), adverse effects may occur
   based on total THQ (TTHQ). The highest TTHQ was found in the species,
   Ostrea rivularis, which had the highest capacity for the bioaccumulation
   (factor > 38) of Cd.},

Abstract = {The coastal lagoons of the Gulf of California support important
   traditional fisheries and mollusc cultures (generally oysters) and
   receive important volumes of agricultural, industrial and urban
   effluents, consumption of the oysters could pose risk to human health.
   The concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), iron
   (Fe), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) in the oysters Saccostrea palmula and
   Crassostrea corteziensis, from four coastal lagoons (Altata, AL;
   Macapule, ML; Navachiste, NL; El Colorado, ECL) in the Southeast Gulf of
   California, were seasonally evaluated (summer 2019-spring 2020). The
   order of magnitude of potentially toxic elements concentrations in the
   soft tissue in both oyster species and at all sites was Zn >Fe > Cu> As
   > Cd >Pb. Cadmium, Cu, Pb, and Zn exceeded the maximum permissible
   limits in more than one sampling site. The highest concentrations (mg
   kg(-1), wet weight) of As (4.2 +/- 1.1, spring) and Cd (3.3 +/- 0.7,
   autumn) were registered in S. palmula et al. and NL sampling sites,
   respectively. Crassostrea corteziensis presented higher levels of Cu
   (40.5 +/- 6.7, spring), Pb (2.0 +/- 0.4, spring), and Zn (96.9 +/- 20.4,
   spring) in ECL and Fe (62.2 +/- 25.4, autumn) in ML. The hazard quotient
   (HQ) values exceeded the safe level of 1 for Cd in S. palmula and C.
   corteziensis in NL for children (similar to 16 kg weight). In addition,
   in children, the hazard index (HI) values in both species of oysters
   ranged from 0.7 to 2.1 and 0.6 to 1.9, respectively. On the other hand,
   the intake of the studied elements through the consumption of oysters
   would not induce adverse effects to human health (men and women weighing
   70 and 60 kg, respectively); HQ and HI values were < 1.},

Title = {Bioaccumulation of Heavy Metals in the Tissue of the Clam <i>Galatea

Abstract = {The concentrations of heavy metals, Mn, Zn, Fe and Hg were determined in
   sediments and in the whole soft tissue of the clam Galatea paradoxa from
   two clam fishing locations, Ada and Aveglo at the Volta estuary in Ghana
   from March to September 2008. Thirty clams were obtained from each
   sampling location monthly and grouped into three size classes of 10
   individuals each based on shell lengths as follows: small (25 -40mm),
   medium (41-55mm), and large (above 55mm). Metal concentrations in the
   tissues of the different clam size-classes from the two stations were
   similar and did not vary significantly. A comparative evaluation of the
   metal concentrations in the clams and sediments however, revealed
   significant variations in concentrations for Zn, Fe and, Hg.
   Concentration of Fe in the sediment from Ada for June was 18 times
   higher than the concentration in the clams similarly, Hg concentrations
   were approximately 5 times higher in the clam tissues than in the
   sediments. On the basis of calculated BSAFs the metal enrichment in the
   tissues of the clams rank in the following order Hg>Mn>Fe. The BSAFs
   indicated a significant accumulation of Hg in the clam tissues relative
   to the concentrations of other metals in the sediments. The
   concentrations of the studied metal in the clam and sediment samples are
   similar to those observed in areas under low pollution impact and the
   current the levels of contamination of these metals in the estuary do
   not exceed the clams' capacity of regulation.},

Abstract = {The Merbok Estuary in Malaysia has a good potential of developing into a
   rich bivalve culture area. However, there is some concern on the
   likelihood of bio-accumulation of heavy metal by the oysters cultured
   there, since Merbok River is classified as very polluted. The
   accumulation of Cu and Zn in oysters (Crassostrea iredalei and
   Crassostrea belcheri) cultured at two locations in the estuary was
   studied. The results indicated that the Cu levels in oysters reaching
   marketable size are within the limit of 40 ppm specified in the
   Malaysian Food Regulations 1985, whereas Zn levels exceeded the limit of
   100 ppm. The metal concentration data were fitted to a first-order
   kinetic model, and good agreement was found between the predicted and
   observed Cu concentrations using the chi(2) test. The Zn data, however,
   did not fit the model. The Cu bioconcentration factors (BCF) for C.
   belcheri cultured at the two locations were found to be about 4.5 x
   10(3), which is close to that for C. iredalei. The results suggests that
   BCF value is site-specific.},

Abstract = {The Golden Horn Estuary and Bosphorus Strait are two major marine
   environments of metropolitan Istanbul which have been exposed to
   intensive industrial discharges for more than 50 years. In the present
   study, concentrations of cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), lead
   (Pb) and zinc (Zn) were measured in mussel tissue and sediment samples
   by using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy to
   assess the current status of metal pollution in the Golden Horn and
   Bosphorus Strait. Ranges of Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn concentrations in soft
   parts of the mussels were BDL-2.59; BDL-7.35; 3.96-20.90; BDL-10.0; and
   124.8-293.2 mu g g(-1) dry weight (dw), respectively, while the ranges
   of Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn in < 63 mu m sediment fractions were BDL,
   19.5-300.3, 16.9-724.7, 10.5-260.9, and 39.3-793.1 mu g g(-1) dw,
   respectively. Ranges of Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn in > 63 mu m sediment
   fractions were BDL, 4.73-52.81, 3.45-481.87, 3.13-174.67 and 10.7-241.2
   mu g g(-1) dw, respectively. Trace metal concentrations found in
   sediment of the Golden Horn were 5-10 times higher than average
   literature values obtained in Mediterranean marine environment, whereas
   those of the Bosphorus Strait were consistent with or slightly higher
   than average literature values.},

Title = {Temporal and spatial trends in heavy metal concentrations in the marine
   mussel <i>Mytilus edulis</i> from the Western Scheldt estuary (The
   Netherlands)},
Journal = {HYDROBIOLOGIA},

Abstract = {Since the first North Sea Conference (1984, Bremen), all countries
   bordering the North Sea made commitments to reduce discharge of
   hazardous substances into the North Sea. From Belgium and The
   Netherlands, large reductions (upto 90\%) in heavy metal emissions from
   land-based sources have been reported between 1985 and 2000. Recently,
   some studies in the Western Scheldt estuary (WS) have shown that total
   metal concentration in the water, sediments and suspended particles have
   decreased compared to levels in the 70s. However, data on aquatic
   organisms is still very limited and it is therefore difficult to confirm
   whether the reductions in pollution input and generally improving water
   quality in the WS have a corresponding impact on the levels of heavy
   metals in aquatic organisms. The current study measured metal
   concentrations in the soft tissues of mussels, Mytilus edulis (known to
   be good indicators of environmental metal pollution) during the period
   1996-2002. Spatial (salinity and pollution gradients), temporal and
   seasonal variations were also studied. Results showed a down-stream
   decreasing trend for the metals studied (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb
   and Zn) during all sampling campaigns. There was also a significant
   seasonal effect on tissue metal concentrations, with a peak observed
   around spring in both WS and the nearby less polluted Eastern Scheldt
   (ES). On temporal trends, a clear drop of metals in mussels was observed
   in the early 80s coinciding with the start of the efforts to reduce
   chemical pollution input into the North Sea. Since those early
   reductions, metal concentrations in mussels generally remained unchanged
   upto mid 90s. However, in recent times metal concentration in mussels
   have increased significantly, for example Cd in 2002 was almost 10 times
   the values in 1983 and similar to levels seen during the peak in the
   70s. Other metals also increased in the 90s also reaching levels seen in
   the 70s. As there is no indication of recent increase in metal input
   into the estuary, we suggest that increased metal concentrations
   observed in mussels in recent years especially in the upper estuary are
   most likely a result of changes in physical and chemical speciation and
   metal bioavailability. Such changes may be caused by changes in some
   water quality parameters in the estuary (i.e. increased dissolved
   oxygen, concentration of organic matter), resulting in conditions that
   favour releases of sediment-bound metals into the water column. The
   relationship between metal content and season showed very similar annual
   profiles in the polluted WS and less polluted ES. Thus, seasonal
   variations in metal concentrations appear to be largely controlled by
   biological processes, while total body burdens are dependent on
   environmental levels and bioavailability.},

Abstract = {This study presents results from the first regional assessment of metal
   levels in translocated blue mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis Lamarck,
   1819) in the nearshore coastal environment across South Australia. A
   total of 422 replicate samples of translocated mussels were deployed
   throughout 11 regions across the South Australian near shore marine
   environment. Mussels were recovered after approximately 70 days and
   analysed for total metal load in the flesh of the mussel. Results showed
   vast differences in metal concentrations between different regions and
   also compared to the baseline metal concentration. Many of these
   differences can be attributed to the level of industrial activity in the
   regions which may have implications for environmental regulation in
   these regions.},

Abstract = {The present study investigates heavy metal concentrations in gastropods
   and bivalves collected from major fishing centers in South India. Three
   gastropods, Bursa spinosa, Tibia curta, and Murex trapa, and two
   bivalves, Perna viridis and Villoritta cyprinoids, were collected for
   the analysis of heavy metals. The metals in the present study followed
   the order Mg > Ca > Zn > Fe > Cu > Mn > Cr > Pb > Ni > Co > Cd. Trace
   metal concentrations in the soft tissue of the molluscs varied as
   follows: for Cd: 0.04-5.33, Co: 0.09-0.87, Cr: 2.18-7.59, Cu:
   9.54-37.02, Mn: 1.30-8.50, Ni: 0.94-3.21, Pb: 1.16-2.64 and Zn:
   68.16-113.64 mg kg(-1). Metal concentrations in all the species were
   below the limits proposed by the World Health Organization, except for
   Pb and Cd. This baseline study suggests that the levels of toxic metals
   in M. trapa, T. curta, and B. spinosa should be continuously monitored
   to assess the fate and effects of these metals in this fragile
   ecosystem. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   gastropod species as bioindicators},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {A comparative assessment of heavy metal accumulation potential in four
   distinct marine benthic bioindicators: the bivalve Perna perna, the
   sponge Callyspongia fibrosa, the sea urchin Tripneustes gratilla, and
   the gastropod Purpura bufo were conducted. These organisms were
   collected from the same location, and the concentration of ten heavy
   metals was analyzed in water, sediment and various body parts of the
   organisms. The bioaccumulation potential was evaluated using the
   bio-water accumulation factor and bio-sediment accumulation factor.
   There was significant variation in the bioaccumulation potential of each
   organism with respect to different metals. The sponge proved to be a
   reliable indicator of Cd with a highest concentration of 2.60 mu g/g.
   Sea urchin accumulated high concentrations of Cr (16.98 mu g/g) and Pb
   (4.80 mu g/g), whereas Cu was predominant (21.05 mu g/g) in gastropod,
   followed by bivalve (17.67 mu g/g). The concentration of metals in hard
   parts was found to be lower than in the tissues.},

Abstract = {Spectroscopic determinations of Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Co and Ni were carried
   out in 23 organisms including seaweeds, zooplankters, molluscs and
   fishes from Hooghly estuary at the confluence of Bay of Bengal. Seaweeds
   and gastropods were more efficient in accumulating levels while
   zooplankters bivalves and fishes showed intermediate levels. Analyses
   were performed on the sediment, water and on the individual dissected
   organs of a mussel, oyster and teleost fish. Bioaccumulation of Fe, Zn,
   Mn and Cu in the soft body parts (gills, mantle, liver etc.) of the
   three species showed a high degree of organ specificity in some cases.
   Major sources of the micropollutants include natural weathering,
   catchment runoff, urban and industrial discharges that may pose an
   ecological risk to the local estuarine ecosystem.},

Title = {Linking environmental heavy metal concentrations and salinity gradients
   with metal accumulation and their effects: A case study in 3 mussel
   species of Vitoria estuary and Espirito Santo bay, Southeast Brazil},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {523},
Pages = {1-15},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {The present study was conducted to link the heavy metal load in three
   species of mussels (Perna perna, Mytella falcata and Mytella guyanensis)
   from the estuaries and bays around Vitoria island, south-east of Brazil,
   with the salinity gradient and the heavy metal levels in the abiotic
   environment (including water, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and
   sediment). Primarily based on the salinity gradient, a total of 26 sites
   around Vitoria Island were selected for sampling of water, SPM,
   sediments and organisms. Besides tissue metal levels, the condition
   index and energy stores (glycogen, lipid and protein) were quantified as
   an indicator of fitness in response to metal pollution. Dissolved metals
   in water indicate that Cd and Mn content was higher along Espirito Santo
   Bay, while Al, Co, Cu, Cr and Fe were elevated in the sites with low
   salinity such as river mouths, estuarine and sewage canals. Likewise,
   suspended matter sampled from low salinity sites showed a higher heavy
   metal load compared to moderate and high salinity sites. Though mussels
   were sampled from different sites, the contamination for Cd, Cu, Fe and
   Mn was higher in mussels inhabiting low salinity sites (M. guyanensis
   and M. falcata) compared to P. perna, a high saline water inhabitant.
   However, a higher Zn body burden was observed for P. perna compared to
   Mytella species. Tissue Fe accumulation (but not Mn and Zn) correlated
   with heavy metal levels in suspended material for all three species, and
   for M. falcata this correlation also existed for Cd and Cu. Energy store
   and condition index in allmussels varied depending on the sampling sites
   and correlated with salinity gradient rather than tissue metal
   concentration. Overall, metal concentration in mussels did not exceed
   the safe levels as per the international standards for metals, and would
   be of no risk for human consumption. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Heavy metal concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Zn, Co, and Pb were
   investigated in soft tissues of Mytilus galloprovincialis coming from an
   aquaculture farm in Cala Iris sea of AlHoceima. Mytilus
   galloprovincialis were collected monthly during the period January to
   December 2016. The seasonal variations were affected significantly the
   concentrations of metals (Cd, Fe and Cr) in M. galloprovincialis. The
   highest heavy metal concentrations were recorded in winter (0.89 mg/kg,
   673.2 and 3.330 mg/kg; for Cd, Fe and Cr, respectively) and the lowest
   values were founded in summer for Cd (0.646 mg/kg), and in autumn for Fe
   (340.1 mg/kg) and Cr (1.959 mg/kg). A significant effect of seasons on
   metal concentrations can be attributed to a number of biological and
   environmental inter-related factors. Data from this study may provide
   information on the use of M. galloprovincialis as a bioindicator for
   heavy metals pollution in the Cala Iris Sea.},

Abstract = {In this study, concentrations of several heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni,
   Cr, and Cd) were measured in Katelysia hiantina, Anomalocardia squamosa,
   Perna viridis, Anadara antiquata, Paphia undulata, and Sanguinolaria
   diphos bivalve mollusks from Da-Peng Bay Lagoon near the
   south-southwestern coast of Taiwan. The metal pollution index (MPI)
   values were highest and lowest in winter and autumn, respectively. The
   MPI value in the viscera of P. viridis was higher than in muscles. In
   all four seasons, Zn concentrations in viscera and muscles of P. viridis
   were higher than for other metals. The capacities of A. squamosa to
   accumulate the concentrations of Cu, Ni, and Cr and of A. antiquata to
   accumulate concentrations of Pb, Zn, and Cd were significant. Analytical
   results suggested that A. squamosa and A. antiquata may be used as
   bioindicators for monitoring Cu, Ni, Cr, Pb, Zn, and Cd heavy-metal
   pollution in Da-Peng Bay Lagoon throughout the year.},

Abstract = {Perna viridis was used as biomonitor to assess heavy metal levels in the
   Chacopata-Bocaripo lagoon axis, Venezuela, during rain and drought
   seasons. The mussels were weighed and measured. The metal concentrations
   were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. For rain period,
   the order of bioavailability was: Cu > Ni > Mn > Co > Cd > Pb, and for
   drought: Cu > Mn > Ni > Co > Pb > Cd. The concentrations of Ni, Co, Cd
   and Pb showed significant differences (P < 0.05) in both periods. There
   was higher metal accumulation during drought season, possibly related to
   upwelling, since it produces an increase in primary productivity, which
   translates more food into organisms, making metals bioavailable for
   mussels. Only Cu and Mn showed significant relationships between the
   size and metal concentration, during drought period, it may be because
   of the organisms need for these essential metals in different
   physiological processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The present work aims to study the metallic contamination of four
   sampling sites located nearby major sewage outfalls of the Casablanca
   coast (Morocco), using indigenous mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis as
   bioindicators of pollution. This research offered the opportunity to
   study trace metals bioaccumulation mechanisms, which represent a major
   factor in assessment processes of the pollution effects in coastal
   ecosystem health. The bioavailability and the bioaccumulation of trace
   metals (Cu, Zn, Ni, Pb) were evaluated in order to compare the metallic
   contamination in mussels' tissues and find a possible correlation with
   physiological parameters of this filter feeding species. Our results
   showed a significant spatiotemporal variation of bioaccumulation,
   compared to control. A significant correlation coefficient between
   metals (Zn and Pb) bioavailability and physiological index (CI) was
   revealed in mussels from the most polluted location. The seasonal
   variation of trace metal accumulation was also raised; the highest
   values recorded during the dry period.},

Abstract = {Heavy metal levels were determined in marine mussels Perna perna
   collected from Ubatuba Bay, northern coast of the State of Sao Paulo,
   Brazil, during the period from January to October 1995. The objective of
   the present study was to analyze the seasonal concentrations of some
   metals of toxicological interest (Cd, Cu, Cr, Pb and Zn) in Ubatuba Bay
   using the bivalve Perna perna (Linnaeus, 1758) as a biological monitor.
   Collections were performed at three month intervals at Itagua beach. In
   the laboratory, the frozen specimens were thawed at room temperature,
   removed from their shells, partially dried on filter paper, weighed and
   individually submitted to acid digestion with sulfuric acid and hidrogen
   peroxide. The analyses for the detection of Cd, Cu, Cr, Pb and Zn were
   carried out by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The results
   showed higher metal accumulation during July. The values detected for Pb
   and Cr were relatively high in all seasons, especially in January and
   July (vacation periods) in Ubatuba Bay, with the consequent risk of
   contamination by mussel ingestion for the local population and for
   tourists from other regions.},

Title = {The Contents of Heavy Metals in Long-Lived Mytilids from Ussuriisky Bay},

Abstract = {The contents of heavy metals (HM) Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn, Cd, and Ni were
   determined in common species of long-lived mussels Crenomytilus grayanus
   (Dunker, 1853) and Modiolus kurilensis F.R. Bernard, 1983 from
   Ussuriisky Bay. Fe and Mn are indicators of the influence of terrigenous
   runoff; Cu and Zn, industrial and municipal waste pollution; and Cd and
   Ni, technogenic impacts. C. grayanus was sampled at eight stations, M.
   kurilensis was collected at one station (Cape Basargin); therefore, the
   HM content in organisms and the environment was mainly assessed from
   analysis of Gray's mussel samples. The current distribution of HM levels
   in mollusks of Ussuriisky Bay was generally more or less uniform. The
   concentration of Cu was only increased in Gray's mussel from Cape
   Telyakovsky, and increased Cd and Ni levels were found in mollusks
   collected from the pier of the port of Vera. In comparison with 2006,
   the upper values of the concentration ranges increased 1.5 times for Zn,
   more than 2 times for Cu, and almost 1.5 times for Cd. In mollusks from
   Lazurnaya Bay (a popular recreation site), the concentrations of Zn and
   Cu, tracers of anthropogenic impacts, increased by 10 and 20\%,
   respectively. Since the mollusks studied are commercially valuable their
   HM content was compared with the maximum permissible concentration
   levels (MPCL). The content of Cd exceeded the MPCL in two specimens of
   Gray's mussels from the pier of the port of Vera and in a single
   specimen from Cape Sedlovidny.},

Abstract = {Individuals of Hexaplex trunculus, Tapes decussatus, and associated
   sediments were collected from 16 coastal sampling plots of the Mar Menor
   lagoon (SE Spain), and the metal and As concentrations were determined.
   The sediments had maximum values (in milligrams per kilogram dry weight
   {[}d.w.]) of 7,132 for Zn; 6,975 for Pb; 5,039 for Mn; 501 for As; 74
   for Cu; and 9.1 for Cd. Specimens of H. trunculus could be collected
   from all the sampling plots, and it was found that concentrations of Zn
   (between 883 and 3,130 mg kg(-1) d.w.), Pb (between 0.09 and 222 mg
   kg(-1) d.w.), Mn (between 7.6 and 17.7 mg kg(-1) d.w.), As (between 144
   and 418 mg kg(-1) d.w.), and Cd (between undetectable and 8.4 mg kg(-1)
   d.w.) in soft tissues significantly increased when concentrations in
   sediments increased. H. trunculus apparently regulated Cu assimilation
   (concentrations between 17.7 and 47.2 mg kg(-1) d.w.) in its soft
   tissues. T. decussatus was very scarce or even absent from sites with
   higher metal and As contents in the sediments. Hence, H. trunculus could
   be used as a bioindicator of metals and As pollution, but not T.
   decussatus. Based on our results, a human health risk exists because the
   species analyzed are collected from the studied zone and so are consumed
   by the population.},

Title = {Seasonal trends of mercury bioaccumulation and assessment of toxic
   effects in Asian clams and microbial community from field study of
   estuarine sediment},

Abstract = {This study investigated seasonal trends in bioaccumulation potential and
   toxic effects of mercury (Hg) in Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea) and
   microbial community. For this, a clam-exposure experiment was performed
   during summer, fall, and winter seasons in four different sites (HS1:
   control/clean site; HS2, HS3, and HS4: contaminated sites) of Hyeongsan
   River estuary, South Korea. Total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg)
   in whole sediments were highest at HS4 site during fall, sustained
   similar levels during winter, but decreased during summer. Unlike whole
   sediment, pore water reported higher levels in summer, and gradually
   declined during fall and winter. Asian clams from HS4 site collected
   during summer presented highest bioaccumulations of THg (521.52 mu g/kg,
   dry weight) and MeHg (161.04 mu g/kg, dry weight), which also correlated
   with the higher levels of Hg present in pore water in the same season.
   Moreover, biota-sediment-pore water accumulation factor (BSpAF) were
   comparatively greater in clams collected from HS2\~{}HS4 compared to HS1
   sites, suggesting that porewater was a better indicator of accumulation
   of Hg. Upregulation of biomarker genes responsible for detoxifying
   process (gsts1), scavenging oxidative stress (cat), and protein
   reparation (hsp70 and hsp90) were observed in clams collected from
   HS2\~{}HS4. The overexpression of these biomarkers implied that Asian
   clams can be considered as promising warning tools for Hg-contamination.
   Both bacterial and metabolic diversities were negatively affected by
   higher levels of THg and MeHg. Phylum Proteobacteria was enriched in
   HS2\~{}HS4 compared to HS1. In contrast, phylum Bacteroidetes showed a
   reverse trend. The metabolic profile was highest in HS1 and lowest in
   HS4, revealing higher stress of Hg in HS4 site. Overall, the outcomes of
   this field study broaden the information on seasonal trends of
   bioaccumulation of Hg and its toxic effects. These findings may be
   helpful in Hg monitoring and management programs in other river systems.},

Title = {Assessment of Metal Levels in Sediments and Oyster (<i>Crassostrea
   gigas</i>) Tissues from Shidugawa Bay, a Closed Japanese Aquaculture

Abstract = {Metals are used as alternatives of antifouling paints in aquaculture and
   toxic to cultured fish and shellfish. To assess antifouling paints,
   metal levels in sediment and in oyster (Crassostrea gigas) collected
   from a Japanese aquaculture were investigated. Elevated metal
   concentrations in sediment were found in the part of the aquaculture
   with high density of fish nets, and significantly positive correlations
   among the metals in sediments indicated that source(s) of these metals
   were common. The levels of metals were slightly higher in oyster tissues
   collected near bottom than near surface of seawater of the aquaculture.
   The levels of Cr, Ni, and As in dry oyster tissues from the aquaculture
   were higher than those from most Japanese coastal areas, while Cu, Zn,
   and Pb in dry basis were lower than those from other areas. Estimated
   daily intake (EDI) for men and women followed the order of Zn > Cu >
   As>Cd > Cr > Ni > Pb. Non-carcinogenic health hazard (HQ) and hazard
   index values (total HQ) of Cd, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, and Pb were lower
   than 1, indicating that women and men would experience no risks of
   studied metals if they ingested the oysters collected from Shidugawa
   Bay, but target cancer risk (TR) of As suggested that oyster may pose
   potential health risk for adult men and women via oyster consumption.
   Thus, continuous monitoring of trace elements in sediments and seafoods
   influenced by antifouling paints should be recommended.},

Abstract = {This paper describes a study of the trace element distribution in
   sediments, marine water and mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis of the
   Venetian Lagoon around the Island of Murano, an island with a long
   tradition of glassmaking. Trace elements analysed include Fe, Mn, Zn,
   Cu, Cr, Pb, Ni, Ag and As. Sediments are contaminated with Zn, Cu, Ag,
   As and Pb, with levels in the <2 m fraction that are likely to cause
   adverse biological effects to marine organisms. The pelite (<63 mum) is
   the main carrier of heavy metals at most sites. However, the
   fine-grained and coarse sand on the southern coast of Murano accounts
   for a significant proportion of Fe, Mn, Zn, Cr, Ag, Ni and Pb. Most
   trace element concentrations found in soft tissue of mussels appear to
   be within recommended Italian and international guidelines for shellfish
   for human consumption, the only exception being relatively high As
   levels. The bioaccumulation of Ag and Cr is more pronounced in the shell
   of these organisms. In the marine water of the lagoon, trace elements
   are more enriched than in other areas of the Mediterranean, with
   particular reference to the dissolved labile species of Zn, Mn, As, Cu,
   Ni and Cr.},

Title = {Estimation of target hazard quotients and potential health risks for

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to describe the impact of metal pollution
   on the main seafood and assess the potential health risk from consuming
   the contaminated seafood in Taiwan. The results of geometric mean (GM)
   metal concentrations in various seafood showed that the copper, zinc,
   and arsenic concentrations in oysters were significantly (p < 0.001)
   higher than those in the other seafood by about 1,057, 74.3, and 56.2
   times, respectively The green color found in the oysters was due to high
   GM copper and zinc concentrations of 909 (ranging from 113-2,805) and
   1,293 (ranging from 303-3,593) mu g/g dry wt, respectively. In addition,
   using a maximum consumption rate of 139 g/day of oysters for
   individuals, calculations yield target hazard quotients (daily
   intake/reference dose) of below 1 for cadmium and mercury and high
   values of 1.61, 9.33, and 1.77 for inorganic arsenic, copper, and zinc
   in adults, respectively. The various lifetime cancer risks for inorganic
   arsenic (maximum exposed individuals risk ranging from 9.93 x 10(-6) to
   3.11 x 10(-4)) might be caused by consuming different seafood in Taiwan.
   The highest risk estimate for inorganic arsenic was 5.10 x 10-4 for
   consumption of oysters by Machu Islands residents. The long-term
   exposure of metals through consumption of oysters, especially for some
   high-risk groups, could be dangerous. Taking inorganic arsenic for
   example, a 10-6 upper limit on lifetime risk as the health protection
   standard would require maximum oyster residue levels of approximately
   0.0076-0.056 mu g/g wet wt, for consumption rates of 139-18.6 g/d. In
   the light of known risks to public health, the government should issue
   an immediate warning to the public to refrain from eating all seafood
   harvested from the Taiwan coastal areas, especially the Hsiangshan area
   and the Machu Islands.},

Abstract = {Bivalves are one of the key components of the biogeochemical cycle in
   the marine system, and respond to heavy metal (HM) sensitively as filter
   feeders. To determine relationship of HMs in edible bivalve and seawater
   and HM effects on human health when digesting bivalves, HMs were
   analyzed in bivalves and seawater. The results showed that the mean HM
   concentrations in bivalves decreased in the order of Zn > Cu > Cr > Pb >
   As > Cd > Hg. Generally, all the bioconcentration factor values of
   bivalves were higher than 100, suggesting that bivalves have a high
   bioaccumulation ability. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis
   indicated that all bivalves have a high bioaccumulation capacity for Cu
   and Zn. It was found that there are health risks associated with
   consuming bivalves, and children are more vulnerable than adults.
   Finally, the maximum allowable consumption rates of non-carcinogenic and
   carcinogenic risk were determined. These results provide the underlying
   insights needed to guide the consumption of seafood.},

Title = {SILVER AND COPPER ACCUMULATION IN 2 ESTUARINE BIVALVES, THE EASTERN

Abstract = {In order to assess the source of trace elements and to compare uptake
   between different bivalve species, oysters and mussels were transplanted
   to five sites in the upper Patuxent River estuary during 1988.
   Transplant sites were located above and below the discharge of Chalk
   Point Steam Electric Station (CPSES)-a historic point source for copper.
   Organisms were sampled approximately monthly for 1 yr and analyzed for
   copper and silver. During spring and summer, concentrations of silver
   and copper increased in oysters at the upstream stations. There was very
   little change in silver and copper concentrations in the mussels with
   either time or among stations. Copper concentrations accumulated by
   oysters approached those found during previous periods when CPSES used
   Cu-Ni alloy condenser tubes (1966-1987), suggesting that corrosion from
   the Cu-Ni condenser tubes was only a minor contributor to the copper
   burdens of oysters in the river nearby. The lack of accumulation by
   mussels at the same sites suggests that part of the reason for the
   accumulation by oysters may be a taxonomically specific physiological
   effect caused by the salinity regime in the upper Patuxent.},

Abstract = {The rate of protein synthesis was significantly decreased in various
   tissues of mussels gathered from a coastal area characterized by a high
   level of pollution when compared with animals collected in the reference
   unpolluted area. Such a decrease may represent a general stress index.
   Additional biological parameters such as amino acid uptake and RNA
   synthesis were similarly decreased in mussels collected from the
   polluted area. In the digestive gland of animals sampled from the heavy
   metal polluted area, the level of low MW thionein-like Cu-binding
   proteins was 3 times higher than in the digestive gland of controls. The
   increase in the level of metallothionein-like proteins in the digestive
   gland of the mussels represented a specific stress index directly
   related to the presence in the seawater of high concentrations of heavy
   metals.},

Abstract = {Concentrations of heavy metals (HM) in water, bottom sediments and soft
   tissues of native bivalves were determined to indicate the level of
   anthropogenic pressure on the Songhua River near Harbin, China. It was
   found that concentrations of six HM (Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb, Zn) ranged from
   0.001 to 0.007 (mg/L) in water and from 0.07 to 5617.13 (mg/kg) in
   bottom sediments. At the study site of the river exposed to severe
   anthropogenic pollution, different bivalves exhibited different rates of
   HM accumulation in their soft tissues. The bioconcentration factors
   (BCF) were calculated for each metal and proved to be significantly
   different in the tissues studied (gills and hepatopancreas). The
   obtained data confirmed the existence of inter-species differences in
   metal accumulation in tissues of the native bivalves. This approach can
   be useful both in comparative physiological studies of the Bivalvia and
   in choosing optimal indicator organisms to assess anthropogenic
   pollution of natural waters of Northern China and the Russian Far East.},

Abstract = {Pb/Ca profiles were measured on ten live collected Ostrea edulis from
   three sites characterized by different levels of lead content.
   Intra-shell and inter-shell reproducibility were tested comparing
   several Pb/Ca profiles measured by LA-ICP-MS within a specimen, and
   within specimens from the same site. Results indicate that signals
   recorded are reproducible and mean shell Pb/Ca values are
   site-dependent. Second order variability is explained either by
   smoothing effects, biological effects or micro-environmental
   heterogeneities in lead distribution. Mean Pb contents measured in
   marine bivalve shells are reviewed here. Ranging from 0 to 50 ppm, they
   show a strong relationship with the environmental level of local lead
   contamination, and do not appear species-dependent. Our measurements
   show a linear relationship between mean shell Pb/Ca and surface sediment
   Pb concentrations, making marine bivalves and particularly O. edulis a
   potential accurate bio-monitoring tool able to monitor bioavailable lead
   along European coasts since Mesolithic, with an annual resolution.},

Abstract = {The southern Atlantic coasts of Morocco are known for their fisheries
   resources and touristic beaches. Although, part of this ecosystem
   received several types of pollutants which are discharged in the
   seawater without any treatment. In previous studies, in which
   acetylcholinesterase and glutathione S-transferase activities were used
   as biomarkers of pollution in Agadir Bay, we demonstrated that marine
   organisms (Donax trunculus, Mytilus galloprovincialis, Perna perna)
   living at the sites receiving domestic and industrial wastewater were
   affected (Najimi et al. 1997; Kaaya et al. 1999; Lagbouri, 1997). The
   study of these organism's biology showed many perturbations in the
   reproductive cycle and growth (Id-Halla et al. 1997; Lagbouri, 1997).
   In order to determinate whether metallic pollution was responsible for
   these perturbations, three heavy metals (zinc as essential metal,
   cadmium and copper known to have toxic effects) were analyzed in
   mussels. In fact, heavy metals were waste products of many industrial
   processes and were important causes of environmental pollution
   (Viarengo, 1985; Viarengo, 1989). Data about heavy metals in marine
   organisms from Moroccan coasts were rare and limited to the north
   Atlantic coasts (El Hraiki et al. 1994, Cheggour et al. 1999). The
   purpose of the present study was to assess the trace-metal content (Cd,
   Cu and Zn) in two species of mussels, the Mediterranean mussel M.
   galloprovincialis and the Africans mussel P. perna, collected in the
   Agadir bay (South of Morocco). The accumulation and transformation
   capabilities of pollutants make these sentinel organisms suitable for
   marine pollution monitoring (Lower and Kendall, 1990). The choice of Cd,
   Cu and Zn in this study, resided in the fact that they were the most
   heavy metals present in the wastewater in the area studied (Bari, 1994).
   Otherwise, this work constituted also a contribution in the assessment
   of the heavy metal level in the African North-West coasts which were
   characterized by an important upwelling. It completes the studies
   realized in the Mauritanian part of these coasts, by Romeo and
   Gnassia-Barelli (1988) and Sidoumou et al. (1992, 1999).
   Considering that many factors could affect the trace metals
   bioaccumulation in mollusks, e.g. physiological state, size and season
   (Romeo and Gnassia-Barelli 1988), our study investigated the metallic
   concentrations according to the season, animal size and distribution in
   organs. It was realized in two different sites of the Agadir bay.},

Abstract = {The present study aimed to determine metal accumulation levels in tissue
   and biomineralisation in shells of 20 species of molluscs (13 gastropods
   and 7 bivalves) from Palk Bay, India. In most cases, metal
   concentrations in the tissues were higher than in the shells of the same
   species collected from same location, meaning that in many cases
   biomineralisation factors of metal ratios were <1. The highest
   biomineralisation factor for Cd was detected in Melampus sincaporensis
   (3.72 +/- 0.1) from the Thondi mangrove, for Pb in Cerithidea cingulata
   (2.51 +/- 0.17) from the Vattanam mangrove, for Cu in Melampus
   sincaporensis (0.88 +/- 0.2) from the Thondi mangrove, and for Zn in
   Cerithidea cingulata (0.93 +/- 0.3) from the Devipattinam mangrove. In
   most cases, metal concentrations were higher than reported in previous
   studies but were within the maximum limits stated by national and
   international regulatory agencies. Variations in the biomineralisation
   factor of metal ratios among the molluscan species likely stems from
   variations in bioaccumulation efficiency, selectivity of individual
   organisms, and availability of metals in the mangrove and coastal
   environments.},

Abstract = {Bioaccumulation of some heavy metals (Cd, Fe, Zn and Cu) in fresh parts
   of 2 bivalvia species (Pinctada radiata Leach, 1814 and Brachidontes
   pharaonis Fischer, 1870) was examined in samples collected between May,
   1999, and April, 2000, in Akkuyu Bay (Icel, Turkey).
   Heavy metal contents in soft bodies were measured by an atomic
   absorption spectrophometer.
   The means of the amounts of heavy metals with standard errors were
   estimated as follows: 0.0605 +/- 0.00467 mu gg(-1) Cd. 2.8227 +/-
   0.24486 mu gg(-1) Fe, 0.2979 +/- 0.02368 mu gg(-1) Zn, and 0.0355 +/-
   0.00303 mu gg(-1) Cu (wet weight) for B. pharaonis, but for P. radiata
   the means were 0.0058 +/- 0.00034 mu gg(-1) Cd, 0.3682 +/- 0.04252 mu
   gg(-1) Fe, 0.1579 +/- 0.00628 mu gg(-1) Zn, and 0.0027 +/- 0.00018 mu
   gg(-1) Cu. In a comparison of the means, the order of magnitude will be
   Fe, Zn, Cd and Cu for B. pharaonis, and Fe, Zn, Cu and Cd for P. radiata
   these results were below Turkish legal standards. Therefore, we may
   conclude that there is no heavy metal pollution in Akkuyu Bay.},

Title = {Can the byssus of green-lipped mussel <i>Perna viridis</i> (Linnaeus)
   from the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia be a biomonitoring organ for
   Cd, Pb and Zn?: Field and laboratory studies},

Abstract = {Concentrations of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) in total soft
   tissues (ST) and byssus (BYS) of the green-lipped mussel Perna viridis
   from I I different geographical locations off the west coast of
   Peninsular Malaysia were determined. The metal concentrations
   distributed between the BYS and ST were compared. The results of this
   study indicated that higher levels of Cd (1.31 mug/g), Pb (38.49 mug/g)
   and Zn (206.52 mug/g) were accumulated in the BYS than in the total ST
   (Cd: 0.29 mug/g; Pb: 8.27 mug/g; Zn: 102.6 mug/g). Semi-static and short
   period controlled laboratory experiments were also conducted for the
   accumulation and depuration of Cd, Pb and Zn in the total ST and BYS of
   P viridis. The ratios (BYS/ST) for Pb and Cd from the laboratory
   experiments showed that the total ST accumulated more metals than the
   BYS. Therefore, these laboratory results disagreed with those found for
   the field samples. However, the laboratory results for the Zn ratio
   (BYS/ST) agreed with those of the field samples. It was evident that
   when compared to the ST, the BYS was a more sensitive biomonitoring
   organ for Zn while it could be a complementary organ for Cd and Pb in
   the total ST. Since total ST of P. viridis had been reported to have
   regulative mechanism for Zn, its BYS can be used as a biomonitoring
   organ for the identification of coastal areas exposed to Zn pollution.

Abstract = {The littoral lagoons of the Gulf of Mexico were investigated to
   determine the amount of heavy metal pollution. Some lagoons have been
   contaminated by liquid wastes mainly originating from sugar refining and
   petrochemical industries, as well as petroleum exploitation and
   refining. Since mollusks concentrate trace elements, determination of
   levels of Cd, Cr, Hg and Pb in oysters (C. virginica) were measured in
   some of these lagoons. Apparently, the concentrations of these metals in
   lagoon water were below the recommended levels to protect aquatic life,
   and it was found that oysters are able to concentrate metals, mainly Cd
   and Pb above the maximum permissible limits for edible consumption.},

Title = {Monitoring of metal pollution in waterways across Bangladesh and
   ecological and public health implications of pollution},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {165},
Pages = {1-9},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Using innovative artificial mussels technology for the first time, this
   study detected eight heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, U, Zn) on a
   regular basis in waterways across Bangladesh (Chittagong, Dhaka and
   Khulna). Three heavy metals, viz. Co, Cr and Hg were always below the
   instrumental detection levels in all the sites during the study period.
   Through this study, seven metal pollution ``hot spots{''} have been
   identified, of which, five ``hot spots{''} (Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb) were
   located in the Buriganga River, close to the capital Dhaka. Based on
   this study, the Buriganga River can be classified as the most polluted
   waterway in Bangladesh compared to waterways monitored in Khulna and
   Chittagong. Direct effluents discharged from tanneries, textiles are,
   most likely, reasons for elevated concentrations of heavy metals in the
   Buriganga River. In other areas (Khulna), agriculture and fish farming
   effluents may have caused higher Cu, U and Zn in the Bhairab and Rupsa
   Rivers, whereas untreated industrial discharge and ship breaking
   activities can be linked to elevated Cd in the coastal sites
   (Chittagong). Metal pollution may cause significant impacts on water
   quality (irrigation, drinking), aquatic biodiversity (lethal and
   sub-lethal effects), food contamination/food security (bioaccumulation
   of metals in crops and seafood), human health (diseases) and livelihoods
   of people associated with wetlands. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The accumulation of six heavy metals (Cr, Cd, Cu, Zn, Pb and Ni) in
   sediment, water and in tissue parts of Mugil cephalus and Crassostrea
   madrasensis was studied in two locations of Pulicat lake, Southeast
   coast of India, which receives considerable quantity of effluents from
   industries located in North Chennai coastal region. The results reveal
   that the metal concentration in water is decreasing in the following
   order of Zn > Ni > Cu > Cr > Pb > Cd both in lake and barmouth and
   highest concentration was observed for Zn (32.5 mu g L-1 in lake and
   25.2 mg L-1 in bar mouth). Metals were highly concentrated in sediments
   when compared to water and biota. Metals abundance in sediments has
   following sequential order of Cr > Ni > Zn > Cu > Pb > Cd and the
   accumulation pattern in barmouth showed minor variation indicating the
   following pattern of Zn > Ni > Cr > Cu > Pb > Cd. The geoaccumulation
   index (I-geo) for Pulicat lake sediments indicate that the sediments are
   extremely contaminated with Cd and moderately contaminated with Cu and
   Ni. Bioaccumulation of heavy metals in Mugil cephalus and Crassostrea
   madrasensis showed marked differences in the accumulation patterns. It
   is observed that Zn, Cu and Pb are accumulated in elevated
   concentrations in various parts of the fish and oyster when compared
   with other metals.},

Abstract = {In this study the effect of lead on condition indices of zebra mussel
   (Dreissena polymorpha) together with the accumulation of lead in the
   soft tissue of mussels, were investigated. Studies showed no significant
   differences in condition indices (TCI and SCI) among the mussels in
   control and lead treatments. Mussels condition indices decreased during
   the experimental period, that it caused by function of time, not by
   metal accumulation. Besides the metal pollution, other environmental
   factors, such as food availability, could affect the mussel's condition.
   In our experiment we removed the effect of food by providing same food
   availability for mussels in control and lead treatments during the
   experiment. Therefore lead is the main effective factor on mussel's
   condition indices. Lead accumulation only observed in the soft tissue of
   mussels. Significant differences in lead accumulation in each treatment
   (based on time) and among treatments were observed. Our results suggest
   that the accumulation of lead in the soft tissue of mussels was affected
   by exposure time and lead concentration in the ambient water. In each
   treatment highest accumulation at longest exposure time (15 days) and
   lowest accumulation at shortest exposure time (5 days) were observed.
   Besides, among treatments, most accumulation of lead in the soil tissue
   of mussels at concentration of (455 mu g L-1) and lowest accumulation
   were observed at concentration of (2 mu g L-1).},

Abstract = {A comparative assessment of the contents of Fe, Zn, Cu, Cd, Mn, Pb, and
   Ni in the soft tissues of bivalve mollusks Mytilus trossulus, Mytilus
   galloprovincialis, and their hybrid forms from Minonosok Bay of Peter
   the Great Bay (Sea of Japan) has been made. No significant differences
   in the accumulation of Fe and Cd in the tissues of all studied groups of
   mollusks were found. It has been shown that the hybrid forms of these
   species had more intensive growth, and against this background they
   accumulated significantly lower concentrations of such metals as Cu, Mn,
   Pb, and Ni in their soft tissues compared to the parental species. A
   significant negative correlation has been found between the accumulation
   of these metals in the tissues of mollusks and the length and weight of
   their shells and whole soft tissues M. trossulus, which had a
   significantly lower weight of valves and soft tissues, differed from M.
   galloprovincialis in the accumulation of significantly higher
   concentrations of Zn, for which no relationship has been found between
   its content and all the studied size and weight characteristics. The
   conducted testing did not reveal any significant dependence of the
   accumulation of all studied metals, with the exception of Pb, in the
   tissues of mollusks on their condition index. The results we obtained
   indicate the need to take the above features of the trace metal
   composition of the soft tissues of the studied species into account when
   using them in monitoring environmental pollution with heavy metals.},

Abstract = {The present study contributes preliminary data concerning the
   concentrations of eleven trace elements contained in Pacific Oysters
   (Crassostrea gigas) cultured in two different bays of Northern Chile,
   where heavy-metal pollution is already recognized as a problem. The
   trace element contents of this mollusc were studied at monthly intervals
   for 12 months (September 1987-August 1988). Copper and cadmium content
   was determined using radiochemical neutron activation analysis.
   Instrumental neutron activation analysis was used for the analysis of
   As, Br, Na, Se, Cr, Ag, Fe, Zn and Co. Various Standard Reference
   Materials were used to determine the accuracy of both methods.
   Significant differences were found comparing the contents of copper,
   cadmium and other elements during different seasons and in different
   locations of capture.},

   elliptica in Maxwell Bay, King George Island, Antarctica},

Year = {1996},
Volume = {32},

Abstract = {Baseline heavy metal concentrations were determined in various tissues
   of the Antarctic soft-shelled clam Laternula elliptica and compared with
   literature values for temperate and Antarctic bivalve species, Laternula
   elliptica tends to strongly accumulate most heavy metals with tissue
   concentrations being comparable to those of mussels and oysters in
   temperate waters, For the majority of the metals, significantly higher
   concentrations were measured in the kidney than in any other soft
   tissues, In addition, Cd concentration in the kidney was positively
   correlated with that of Zn, Pb and Mn, reflecting the detoxification of
   the accumulated heavy metals, Thus, these results suggest that L.
   elliptica can be used as a suitable biomonitor for long-term monitoring
   of heavy metal contamination in the Antarctic coastal waters, However,
   habitat sediment is highly elevated with Cu (77 mu g g(-1) dry weight),
   which has apparently been derived from lithogenic sources in the
   surrounding land via meltwater inflow during austral summer, No
   comparative data, however, are yet available for L. elliptica in other
   regions, and possible influence of the Cu elevation in this region on
   the body burden of L. elliptica is discussed in comparison with those of
   another common Antarctic bivalve, Adamussium colbecki. Copyright (C)

Title = {An updated ecotoxicological evaluation and health risk assessment of
   metal contaminants in <i>Perna</i> viridis mussel harvested on March to
   August 2018 from Pasir Gudang Coastal Area, Malaysia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FOOD COMPOSITION AND ANALYSIS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {132},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Perna viridis (P. viridis) is a significant protein source globally but
   is often contaminated by metals due to its filter-feeding behavior.
   Given that Kampung Pasir Puteh, Pasir Gudang (Johor) is Malaysia's
   primary P. viridis harvesting site and the last health risk assessment
   (2015) was incomplete, the metal contamination status remains uncertain.
   Graphite furnace-atomic absorption spectroscopy was employed to analyze
   metal contaminant concentrations in P. viridis samples collected from
   March to August 2018, as per Malaysian legal requirements. The R-2
   values varied between 0.9976 and 0.9980 for P. viridis mussels and
   between 0.9976 and 0.9999 for seawater. The recovery for P. viridis
   mussels and seawater ranged from 93.95\% to 106.80\% and 92.73-108.84\%,
   respectively. Precision and accuracy for both intra and inter-day
   measurements ranged from 0.15\% to 5.49\% for P. viridis and 0.05-5.58\%
   for seawater. The concentrations of metal contaminants in P. viridis
   varied significantly among the different months of sampling (p < 0.05).
   All P. viridis samples had higher concentration of arsenic (3.16-75.80
   mu g g(-1)) than that prescribed by the Malaysian law. Higher cadmium
   concentration was observed during July (2.12 mu g g(-1)) and August
   (2.05 mu g g(-1)) alone. With target hazard quotients and hazard indices
   > 1.0, the likelihood of negative health impacts from consuming these
   mussels cannot be ignored. TCR values for As and Cd exceeded USEPA
   standards, indicating a potential lifetime carcinogenic risk from
   continuous P. viridis consumption. Pb (21.20-49.28 mu g L-1) in all
   surface seawater samples was invariably higher than the allowable limit
   for Class 2 water areas. Metal contaminant concentrations varied
   significantly between P. viridis and surface seawater (p < 0.05),
   implying inconsistent bioaccumulation due to pollution differences.
   Given the significance of P. viridis mussels, concerted scientific
   efforts are essential to devise effective metal contaminant removal
   methods.},

Abstract = {Two marine bivalves, Mytilus galloprovincialis and Callista chione, were
   exposed to various concentrations of cadmium and nickel (0.5, 1.0, 2.5
   and 20ppm), for 20 days, plus 10 days' depuration period, in a
   laboratory experiment. Animals from each experimental condition were
   dissected and the bioaccumulation and distribution of Cd and Ni were
   determined in their gills, mantles and remaining bodies. The
   concentrations of Fe and Zn were also measured. Heavy metal tolerance,
   bioconcentration and distribution of heavy metals in tissues were
   considerably different in M. galloprovincialis and C. chione: (i) both
   animals were tolerant to Ni pollution, even at the highest concentration
   used; (ii) C. chione was more tolerant to Cd; (iii) M. galloprovincialis
   was a better Cd and Ni accumulator, with the exception of the highest Cd
   concentration tested, where C. chione accumulated more Cd; (iv) Fe and
   Zn levels were much more affected in M. galloprovincialis; (v) in
   general, accumulation and distribution of Ni and Cd in the tissues were
   metal-, species- and time of exposure- dependent; (vi) significant
   amounts of heavy metals remained in the tissues after 10 days'
   depuration. Our results support a hypothesis for a two competing
   processes mechanism for metal accumulation and detoxification.},

Abstract = {The industrial and domestic wastes of Vladivostok, the biggest city in
   the Russian Far East, have led to the increasing pollution of
   neighbouring coastal waters by heavy metals (Zn, Cn, Pb and Cd), The
   seasonal and spatial variability of Zn, Cu, Pb, and Cd concentrations in
   the common molluscs Mizuchopecten yessoensis, Crenomytilus grayanus and
   Modiolus kurilensis around Vladivostok were studied, There are large
   seasonal changes in the metal contents of the molluscs resulting from
   variations of filtration rate (for Zn and Cd) and differences in
   physiological state (for Cn and Pb), For Modiolus kurilensis the change
   in tissue weight during the reproductive cycle is also significant.
   Simultaneous sampling during the summer showed that agreement between
   pollution levels in sediments and in tin molluscs was observed for Cu
   only, The Pb and Cd concentrations in molluscs reached maximum values in
   the outer zones of the polluted region, but Pb and Cd contents in the
   molluscs decreased in the harbour localities where sediment metal loads
   indicated heavy pollution. It is supposed that: in such localities with
   high inputs of metals and organic substances, the molluscs may filter
   smaller volumes of the contaminated water and thus accumulate smaller
   quantities of metals.},

Abstract = {The shells of mussels, live-collected bivalves or during archaeological

   the shells from the Middle Ages were: 137.5 (Fe), 3.87 (Zn), 0.789 (Cu),
   0.012 (Pb), 0.047 (Ni), and 0.0009 (Cd). Shells from the 21st century
   were significantly (P<0.05) more abundant in Fe, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Cd
   (rates of increase: 1.96x, 3.54x, 2.71x, 2.08x, and 3.55x, respectively)
   than shells from the Middle Ages. These results reflect contemporary
   anthropogenic pollution of the environment with heavy metals and confirm
   the possibility of using U. tumidus shells in the assessment of heavy
   metal pollution levels.},

Title = {High bioaccumulation factors and ecological risk index of Cd and Hg in
   Indian white shrimp, hooded oyster, brown algae, and Sediment in
   northern coasts of the Gulf of Oman before and after a monsoon},

Abstract = {This study analyzed the concentrations (dry weight basis) and
   bioaccumulation factors (BAF) of copper (Cu), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd),
   and mercury (Hg) in pre- and post-monsoon samples at five stations
   (Chabahar, Darak, Gowatr, Jask, and Pozm) in the Gulf of Oman. For this
   purpose, ten samples of hooded oyster Saccostrea cucullata, brown algae
   Sargassum ilicifolium, and Indian white shrimp Penaeus indicus were
   collected once a month during fall and spring (a total of 60 samples
   were obtained from each species per station). Additionally, sediment
   samples were collected three times a month during these two seasons (ten
   samples per each season). Our results indicated that metal
   concentrations were lower than the maximum permitted limit in the
   sediment across the tested stations (<0.42 ppm). In both seasons, the
   highest concentrations of metals in the sediment were found in Chabahar,
   followed by Jask. The concentration of Hg was higher in the Indian white
   shrimp (0.16 ppm) and hooded oyster (0.20 ppm) than in the standard
   (0.10 ppm), while for other metals and tissues the concentrations were
   lower than the standard level. Also, BAF of Hg was higher than the
   standard permissible level in Jask(spring: 109.71\%) and Pozm station
   (spring: 123.12\%, fall: 125.76\%). Except for Cd and Cu at the Chabahar
   station, the monsoon did not have any significant effect on metal
   concentrations and bioaccumulation. Preventive measures and management
   strategies are required as these concentrations and BAF of metals can
   become an actual threat to the environment and human health in this
   area. Crown Copyright (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Trace metals were determined in the two most abundant species of bivalve
   molluscs along the Atlantic coast of southern Spain (Donax trunculus and
   Chamelea gallina) and in the sediments where they live. The results show
   that the area near the mouth of the Huelva estuary is where the highest
   metal concentrations are found in sediments and in the two bivalve
   species. This is not surprising, considering that the Huelva estuary is
   the mouth of the Tinto and Odiel rivers, which have one of the highest
   levels of metal pollution of all the rivers of Europe. The two species
   of bivalves have different amounts of metals in their tissues. The
   concentrations of Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn, As and Hg in D. trunculus were
   significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in C gallina; however, C. gallina
   contained more Ni and Cd. In both species the most abundant elements
   were Cu and Zn, while Hg showed the lowest values. There is a
   significant correlation (< 0.05) for concentrations of Cu, Pb, Zn and Hg
   in D. trunculus and C gallina relative to their concentrations in
   surface sediments. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The concentrations of trace metals (Pb, Cd, Zn, Cu, Fe, and Cr), from
   three coastal lagoons (Mecoacan, Carmen and Machona) In the southern
   Gulf of Mexico, were measured in oysters and recent sediments. The mean
   values in oysters were lower than those found in the northern Gulf of
   Mexico, with the exception of copper in Mecoacan and chromium in the
   three lagoons. The mean values in sediments were much lower than those
   in the northern Gulf, with the exception of cadmium, that presented
   similar values in both places. Significant correlations were found
   between the condition index and salinity (r=0.645) and the concentration
   of copper (r=-0.652). It is concluded that the diminishing yields of
   oysters in these lagoons is due to a complex interaction of coastal zone
   and fisheries mismanagement, the presence of parasites and pollution.

Abstract = {Live specimens of the clam Venerupis decussata were suspended in
   seawater of the Mazagon Marina, located in a heavy metal polluted area
   at the mouth of Huelva Estuary (SW Spain). Clams were preserved in
   plastic cages and subsamples were recovered every 5 days over a period
   of 40 days. Water from the marina was sampled every two days during the
   time course of the experiment. Clams and water were analyzed for metals
   and organotins. Results showed the accumulation of Mn, Cu, Fe, V, Zn and
   tributyltin in the bivalves reaching an equilibrium with the surrounding
   water. Bioconcentration factors ranged from 10(2) (for V) to 4x10(3)
   (for Cu). Clams also accumulated Al and Pb but a steady state was not
   reached. A first-order kinetic model was applied to the data and results
   indicated that rates of accumulation differed in relation to clam size
   class. Clam mortality increased during the experiment and was total
   after 42 days which was attributed to the high concentration of Cu in
   seawater.},

Abstract = {Samples of Pacific oysters, C. gigas, cultured in Deep Bay, Hong Kong,
   were collected for analysis of various heavy metal contents: Fe, Cu, Pb,
   Cd, Mn, Cr and Zn. The gill had the highest metal contents, followed by
   the mantle, viscera, with the smallest amount being observed in the
   adductor muscle. All metal contents were within the range reported for
   the same species in areas where heavy metal pollution was already
   recognized as a problem. A long-term monitoring program measuring the
   contents of various metals in seawater, sediment and oysters is
   essential.},

Title = {A Comparative Study of Mercury Bioaccumulation in Bivalve Molluscs from
   a Shallow Estuarine Embayment},
Journal = {ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {86},

Abstract = {In estuarine food webs, bivalve molluscs transfer nutrients and
   pollutants to higher trophic levels. Mercury (Hg) pollution is
   ubiquitous, but it is especially elevated in estuaries historically
   impacted by industrial activities, such as those in the U.S. Northeast.
   Monomethylmercury (MeHg), the organic form of Hg, is highly
   bioaccumulative and transferable in the food web resulting in the
   highest concentrations in the largest and oldest marine predators.
   Patterns of Hg concentrations in marine bivalve molluscs, however, are
   poorly understood. In this study, inorganic Hg (iHg), MeHg, and the
   total Hg (THg) in soft tissues of the northern quahogs (Mercenaria
   mercenaria), eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica), and ribbed mussels
   (Geukensia demissa) from eastern Long Island sound, a temperate estuary
   of the western North Atlantic Ocean was investigated. In all three
   species, concentrations of THg remained similar between the four
   sampling months (May, June, July, and September), and were mostly
   independent of animal size. In quahogs, MeHg and iHg displayed
   significant (p < 0.05) positive (iHg in May and June) and negative (MeHg
   in July and September) changes with shell height. Variability in
   concentrations of THg, MeHg, and iHg, both inter- and intra-specifically
   was high and greater in quahogs and oysters (THg: 37, 39\%, MeHg: 28,
   39\%, respectively) than in mussels (THg: 13\%, MeHg: 20\%). The
   percentage of THg that was MeHg (\%MeHg) was also highly variable in the
   three species (range: 10-80\%), highlighting the importance of measuring
   MeHg and not only THg in molluscs.},

   0.002-0.004 mg/kg; Pb - 0.011-0.029 mg/kg; Hg - 0.050-0.070 mg/kg; iAs
   lower than 0.02 mg/kg. The highest concentrations of metals occurred in
   outer bay sediments: Cd - 0.829 mg/kg dw; Pb - 21.54 mg/kg dw; Hg -
   0.305 mg/kg dw; iAs - 0.02 mg/kg dw. Metal concentrations in mussels
   were at low levels. High Pb content (1.915 mg/kg ww) was only determined
   in samples collected at the station near the brine outfall. Conclusions:
   Concentrations of toxic metals in the fishes, sediments, and mussels
   from the Puck Bay indicated that the environment of the bay was in good
   condition.},

Abstract = {Concentrations of Zn and Cd in whole soft parts of mussels, M. edulis
   (L.), collected from 54 locations in Scandinavian waters were
   determined. Local variations in concentrations of the 2 metals found in
   samples taken close to industrial sources of Zn and Cd confirmed the
   ability of the mussel to act as an accurate indicator of pollution by
   these metals over the entire range of salinities in which this species
   can exist. Offshore samples remote from industrial discharges revealed
   higher concentrations of Zn and Cd in mussels from low-salinity areas
   (Gulf of Finland, Southern Bothnian Sea, Baltic proper) than in those
   from high-salinity areas (Kattegat, Eastern Skagerrak). Major decreases
   in metal concentrations present in the mussel were apparent in the
   regions of the Sound and the Great Belt, which are areas of rapid
   salinity change due to mixing of Baltic water with water from Kattegat.
   Comparison of these results with those reported for Zn and Cd in water
   throughout the study area suggested the existence of a higher biological
   availability of these metals in regions of low salinity; possible
   reasons for this are discussed. Data from the present survey are also
   compared to those reported formussels taken elsewhere. This comparison
   reveals the Baltic area to be considerably polluted by trace metals; the
   waters of Kattegat and Skagerrak are relatively unpolluted.},

Abstract = {A large scale study of trace metal contamination (Hg, Cd, Pb and Ni) by
   means of caged mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis was undertaken along
   the coastal waters of the Western Mediterranean Sea within the context
   of the MYTILOS project. Individual mussels from an homogeneous
   population (shell size 50 +/- 5 mm) obtained from an aquaculture farm
   were consecutively caged and deployed at 123 sites located in the
   Alboran, North-Western, South-Western and Tyrrhenian sub-basins for 12
   weeks (April-July) in 2004, 2005 and 2006. After cage recoveries, both
   the metal content in the whole mussel tissue and the allometric
   parameters were measured. Statistical analysis of the datasets showed
   significant differences in concentrations between sub-basins for some
   metals and mussel condition index (CI). Linear regression models coupled
   to the CI were revisited for the data adjustment of certain trace metals
   (Hg, Cd and Ni), and four level categories were statistically derived to
   facilitate interregional comparison. Seawater masses surrounding coastal
   areas impacted by run-off from land mineralised coasts and industrial
   activities displayed the highest concentration ranges (Hg: 0.15-0.31 mg
   kg(-1) dw; Cd: 1.97-2.11; Ni: 2.18-3.20 and Pb: 3.1-3.8), although the
   levels obtained in most of the sites fitted within moderate or low
   categories, and they could be considered as baseline concentrations.
   However, few sites considered little-influenced by human activities, at
   present, showed high concentrations of Cd, Ni and Pb, which constitute
   new areas of concern. Overall, the use of active biomonitoring (ABM)
   approach allowed to investigate trace metal contamination in order to
   support policy makers in establishing regional strategies (particularly,
   with regard to the European Marine Strategy Directive).},

Abstract = {Biomonitoring of coastal areas using marine organisms is an attractive
   approach for studying pollution caused by anthropic discharges. Most of
   the experiments are based on the collection and analysis of native
   organisms, but this method has the disadvantage of dealing with many
   natural variations. In this work, the marine bivalve Perna perna, very
   abundant in the coast of the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, was
   transplanted from a mussel farm and used for biomonitoring of four
   sites, situated in coastal regions close to domestic and/or industrial
   discharges. Hg, Cd and Pb were determined in the transplanted organisms
   by AAS and As, Ca, Co, Cr, Fe, Na, Se and Zn were determined by INAA.},

Abstract = {Existing data on metal concentrations in mussels from subarctic,
   temperate, subtropical and tropical waters were analyzed using
   multivariate statistics in order to assess regional variations in metal
   contamination. Potential errors were reduced by only analyzing data from
   surveys that employed the same protocols, analytical methodologies and
   analysts. Factor analysis demonstrated that mussels inhabiting extremely
   contaminated areas (e.g. from Japanese and Swedish metallurgy sources)
   could be separated from mussels from other contaminated areas, and that
   metals such as Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn could be used to identify heavily
   contaminated samples while Co, Fe, Cr and Ni concentrations were good
   markers for exposure to inputs from different industrial sources.
   Furthermore byssus, like soft tissue, selectively and sensitively
   reflects variations of certain metal concentrations in ambient waters
   and thus serves as a reliable biomonitor for these contaminants in a
   variety of coastal and estuarine areas. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Seasonal variations in metal concentrations in soft tissues of marine
   mussels can be due, to a great extent, to seasonal changes in flesh
   weight. Consequently, this event results in an unpredictable
   overestimation of metal bioavailability when the metal concentration in
   soft tissues is considered as an index of such metal bioavailability.
   The Abra estuary (Bizkaia, Bay of Biscay, Spain) was used as a natural
   experimental basin with well-known differences in the levels of metallic
   pollutants. The level of metal bioavailability was determined at various
   sites at different times of the year. For this purpose the conventional
   approach of recording metal concentrations in soft tissues and the
   approach based on the calculation of metal/shell-weight indices, first
   proposed by Fischer (1983), were applied. We concluded that seasonal
   changes in organism condition (Flesh Condition Index) cause
   unpredictable oscillations in the metal concentration in soft tissues.
   For this reason the direct use of metal concentration values is not
   recommended to assess metal bioavailability. The metal/shell-weight
   indices, however, were not affected by seasonal changes in the flesh
   weight of sentinel mussels and thus may provide a more realistic
   indication of metal bioavailability. In the present study, different
   metal bioavailabilities, assessed by metal/shell-weight indices, were
   found at different sampling sites, according to the influence of
   industrial activities. Seasonal trends in metal/shell-weight indices
   (attributed to different metal inputs at different times) were also
   recorded. In conclusion, metal/shell-weight indices, characterized by a
   high sensitivity and a low noise-to-signal ratio, are a simple and
   reliable tool for assessing metal bioavailability in `Mussel Watch'
   monitoring programmes.},

Abstract = {Assessment of trace metals (Zn, Cu, Fe, Pb and Ni) in water, sediment
   and an oyster, Saccostrea cucullata, was carried out in five stations
   around Port Blair. Concentration of these metals in water, sediment and
   the oyster exhibited wide variations. Among the selected locations,
   Fisheries Jetty exhibited the highest concentration of trace metals, as
   a consequence of the numerous fishing vessels harboured at this station.
   Zinc was the highest bioconcentrated trace metal (BCFmw,460.39 -
   2474.72; BCFms, 24.60 - 641.96) in all the five stations, probably due
   to the role of several zinc metalloenzymes in shell mineralization of
   oysters. Unlike this, the bioconcentration factor of Pb was very low in
   spite of its relatively high concentrations in both, water as well as
   sediment.},

Abstract = {In order to test the aptitude of individuals of Mytilus chilensis as
   biomonitors of heavy metals pollution in seawater, several samples of
   this mollusk together with surrounding seawater samples were collected
   along 170 km of the coastal area of the Beagle Channel (Tierra del
   Fuego, Argentina) in 2005 and 2007. The study, performed in seven
   locations strategically selected, involved the determination of Cd, Cr,
   Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn in seawaters and mollusks by atomic absorption
   spectrometry (AAS) and the calculation of the respective concentration
   factors (CFs). Obtained data were standardized and analyzed by
   multivariate techniques in order to establish differences between
   sampling sites and periods. Obtained results will be shown and the
   bioaccumulation ability of M. chilensis will be evaluated by comparison
   with results obtained for Mytilus species in different geographical
   marine areas. A fully discussion on the possibility of employing the
   results as background levels for comparative purposes in other marine
   waters of the world will be provided. The possible harm derived from
   human consumption of these mollusks will be also assessed.},

Abstract = {Mussels pose health risks to consumers through accumulation of trace
   metals from the ocean. Saldanha Bay, South Africa, has heavy industry
   and international shipping, creating concerns over pollution levels for
   aquaculture facilities. Samples of C. meridionalis and M.
   galloprovincialis were collected from mussel rafts over two-years and
   analysed for trace metal content using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass
   Spectrometry. Aluminium, Cr, Fe, Zn, Cd and Pb were higher in M.
   galloprovincialis, while C. meridionalis accumulated more Cu and Mn.
   Temporal fluctuations occurred for Fe and As concentrations in C.
   meridionalis, and Fe, As, Hg and Pb in M. galloprovincialis. Arsenic
   exceeded South African regulatory limits (3 mg/kg) once in each species
   (max = 3.4 mg/kg w.w.). Lead concentrations in M. galloprovincialis were
   within EU regulatory limits for bivalves (1.5 mg/kg) but exceeded SA
   regulatory limits for fish (0.5 mg/kg) four times. Overall, farmed
   mussels from Saldanha Bay were determined to be safe for human
   consumption.},

Abstract = {A study was performed in 2003 to 2004 to assess metal and organic
   contaminant concentrations at three areas in the lower Cape Fear River
   system, North Carolina, United States. Sites examined were Livingston
   Creek along the mainstem of the Cape Fear River near Riegelwood, Six
   Runs Creek in the Black River Basin, and Rockfish Creek in the Northeast
   Cape Fear River basin. The results of the investigation showed that
   levels of metals and organic pollutants in the sediments were lower than
   limits considered harmful to aquatic life. However, results of fish
   (adult bowfin) tissue analyses showed that concentrations of arsenic
   (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), selenium (Se), and now-banned
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and the pesticide dieldrin were higher
   than levels considered safe for human consumption by the United States
   Environmental Protection Agency and the North Carolina Health Director's
   Office. Fish tissue concentrations of Hg, Se, and PCBs were also higher
   than concentrations determined by researchers to be detrimental either
   to the health of the fish themselves or their avian and mammalian
   predators. Due to the rural nature of two of the sites, increased
   concentrations of As, Cd, Se, and PCBs in fish tissue were unexpected.
   The likely reason the levels are increased in fish and some clams but
   not in sediments is that these pollutants are biomagnified in the food
   chain. These pollutants will also biomagnify in humans. In these rural
   areas there is subsistence fishing by low-income families; thus,
   increased fish tissue metals and toxicant concentrations may present a
   direct threat to human health.},

Abstract = {The concentrations of Cu, Cd, Pb, Zn, and Hg in diploid and triploid
   oysters from three farms (Guasave, Ahome, and Navolato) on the
   north-central coast of Sinaloa, Mexico, were assessed based on samples
   recovered during a single culture cycle 2013-2014. Metal burdens were
   more strongly correlated (p < 0.05) with the location of the farm than
   with either the ploidy or the interaction of both variables. The metal
   concentration ranking for oysters of both ploidies from the three farms
   was Zn > Cu > Cd > Pb > Hg. For all three farms, the mean concentrations
   of Cd and Pb in Crassostrea gigas were high, ranging from 2.52 to 7.98
   mu g/g wet weight for Cd and from 0.91 to 2.83 mu g/g wet weight for Pb.
   Diploid and triploid oysters from the Guasave farm contained high levels
   of Cu (76.41 and 68.97 mu g/g wet weight, respectively). Cu, Cd, and Zn
   were highly correlated (p < 0.05), and their concentrations may be
   influenced by agrochemical inputs. The mean levels of Cu for the Guasave
   farm and of Cd and Pb for all three farms exceeded permissible limits
   and represented a threat to human health during the sampling period
   (July 2014 to July 2014).},

Abstract = {Sharks are particularly susceptible to bioaccumulation due to their life
   history characteristics and trophic position within marine ecosystems.
   Despite this, studies of bioaccumulation cover only a small proportion
   of extant species. In this study we report concentrations of trace
   elements and heavy metals in blood samples of Sphyrna lewini for the
   first time. We report high concentrations of several trace elements and
   heavy metals, with concentrations of some elements exceeding the limit
   determined safe for human consumption. High elemental concentrations may
   reflect biochemical differences between blood plasma and other tissues;
   however, they may also be symptomatic of high levels of exposure
   triggered by anthropogenic activities. We also provide evidence of
   elemental accumulation through ontogeny, the nature of which differs
   from that previously reported. Ultimately, this baseline study increases
   our understanding of interspecific and intraspecific variation in
   bioaccumulation and ecotoxicology in elasmobranchs which may prove
   important in ensuring adequate management.},

Abstract = {Mercury concentrations in oysters from four estuaries in northeastern
   Brazil varied following source changes during the past 13 years.
   Concentrations were higher in urban estuaries relative to rural areas,
   but decreased in the 13-years interval following improvements in solid
   wastes disposal and sewage treatment. In rural estuaries, the one
   located in an environmental protection area showed no changes in Hg
   concentrations in the period. However, in the Jaguaribe estuary,
   remobilization from soils and sediments due to regional environmental
   changes, increased Hg concentrations in oysters to values similar to the
   most contaminated metropolitan sites.},

Abstract = {Bivalves are regularly used as biomonitors of contaminants in coastal
   and estuarine waters. We used oysters to assess short term changes in
   metal availability caused by the resuspension of contaminated sediments.
   Sydney Rock Oysters, Saccostrea glomerata, were deployed at multiple
   sites in Port Kembla Harbour and two reference estuaries for 11 weeks
   before dredging and for two equivalent periods during dredging.
   Saccostrea experienced large increases in accumulation of zinc, copper
   and tin during dredging in the Port relative to oysters deployed in
   reference estuaries. Lead and tin were found to be permanently elevated
   within Port Kembla. We present a clear and un-confounded demonstration
   of the potential for dredging activities to cause large scale increases
   in water column contamination. Our results also demonstrate the
   usefulness of external reference locations in overcoming temporal
   confounding in bioaccumulation studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Studies were carried out to investigate the contamination of Piracicaba
   and Mogi-Guacu River basins (Sao Paulo State, Southeastern, Brazil)for
   heavy metals (Cd and Pb), using the limnic bivalve Anodontites
   trapesialis as a biological Monitor. The results showed that the
   concentrations of Pb were higher than the control group in both basins,
   showing the bioavailability of this non-essential element in the basins.
   The concentrations were higher in the Mogi-Guacu than in the Piracicaba
   basin, and in the slightly contaminated sites in both basins. There was
   no correlation between the degree of human impact and Cd and Pb
   concentrations, it was not possible to infer about concentrations of
   these heavy metals in the bivalves based only in a broad evaluation of
   human impact.},

Title = {Hazardous impacts of heavy metal pollution on biometric and biochemical
   composition of pearl oyster <i>Pinctada radiata</i> from five sites
   along Alexandria coast, with reference to its potential health risk
   assessment},

Abstract = {This study investigated the effect of heavy metals on the pearl oyster
   Pinctada radiata from 5 sites along the coast of Alexandria, with focus
   on its ecological health and potential risks to human consumption.
   Pollution results showed that Abu-Qir had the highest Cu and Cd values.
   Montaza and Eastern Harbor had the highest Fe and Pb values,
   respectively. Statistically, differences in metal concentrations among
   study sites were significant (p < 0.05). Non-carcinogenic risk (TTHQ) of
   tested metals and carcinogenic ones of Cd and Pb showed ``high risk{''}
   on human health by consuming pearl oysters. Morphometric measurements
   and condition indices were studied to assess growth patterns and health
   in relation to heavy metals exposure. Key findings showed detectable
   declines in size and condition index in Eastern Harbor, whereas Abu-Qir
   recorded the highest values. This condition index performance presented
   Abu-Qir, Mammora, and Miami as ideal locations for spat collection and
   oyster rearing, potentially enhancing Egyptian pearl farming. Average
   values of spatial proximate contents of pearl oyster showed that it was
   rich in proteins (33.07-58.52\%) with low fat content (1.39-1.87\%) and
   carbohydrates (9.72-17.63\%). Biochemical composition of pearl oyster
   demonstrated its high nutritional value which supported its promotion as
   a functional food for human consumption. The calorie content of pearl
   oyster was less than 2 Kcal, making this species an alternative source
   of healthy food to reduce obesity. Regression analysis indicated that
   Cu, Cd, and Pb had significant effect on 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl
   (DPPH) scavenging activity, calories, vitamins, and pigment content of
   the collected oysters.},

Abstract = {Heavy metal accumulation levels in the soft tissue of mussel (Mytilus
   galloprovincialis Lamarck, 1819) individuals, collected from eight
   stations along the 122 km long Giresun coast, were investigated. Heavy
   metal levels (Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, As, and Se) were
   determined by using Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometer (ICP
   MS). Results were given as mu g/g in wet weight mean +/- SE; Cr; 0.56
   +/- 0.03, Mn; 6.23 +/- 0.38, Ni; 12.70 +/- 1.01, Zn; 69.06 +/- 4.20, Co;
   1.97 +/- 0.07, Cu; 2.65 +/- 0.18, Fe; 161.08 +/- 15.89, Pb; 3.16 +/-
   0.08, As; 3.16 +/- 0.11, and Se; 0.62 +/- 0.05. Metal concentrations in
   descending order were as follow; Fe > Zn > Ni > Mn > As > Pb > Cu > Co >
   Se > Cr, respectively. Length and weight distribution of mussel samples
   were significantly different between some stations (p<0.05). The mean Pb
   and Zn concentrations were higher than the acceptable limit proposed by
   International Turkish standards.},

Title = {Distribution of heavy metals in sediments and their bioaccumulation on
   benthic macroinvertebrates in a tropical Brazilian watershed},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {163},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {The objectives of this study were (i) to evaluate the quality of the
   Ouro River, a tropical Brazilian river, assessing the concentration of
   the metals in surface waters, sediments, and benthic macroinvertebrates;
   (ii) to investigate the possible sources of pollution in Ouro River
   basin through field research and spatial analysis (G.I.S.); (iii) to
   evaluate the possible occurrence of metals bioaccumulation in the
   trophic chain, by comparing the concentration of the metals in water,
   sediments (total and bioavailable) and in benthic macroinvertebrates;
   and (iv), to assess the biological metrics of benthic macroinvertebrates
   that inhabit the Ouro River, and the possible relation regarding its
   distribution (richness, abundance, dominance) with the human occupancy.
   Water, sediment, and macroinvertebrates samples were assessed in five
   sample sites for 9 months. The macroinvertebrates were arranged,
   identified, and analyzed taxonomically. The concentrations of Cu, Zn,
   Fe, Mn, Cd, Pb, and Cr in waters and sediments (total and Mehlich-1)
   were determined, the obtained results were compared to Brazilian and
   international standards indexes (Igeo and E.F.). According to our
   findings, the quality of Ouro River is directly affected by the human
   activities carried out in the watershed, and despite that the vast
   majority of the assessed metals in water was found below the legislation
   maximum levels, these accumulate in sediments, with extremely high
   enrichment of Cd, and moderately to heavily contamination of Cd, Mn, and
   Cu. Also, Zn and Pb high bioaccumulation in macroinvertebrates was
   observed, in which concentrations were 172\% and 92\% higher than the
   mean total concentration in sediment. The fit?s goodness indicates that
   Mehlich-1 could be used as an extractant solution for the correlation of
   Pb in sediments and B.M.I. On average, Pb levels in the benthic are
   14.94? higher than the bioavailable fraction in sediments (Mehlich-1).
   Mainly for Decapoda, Bivalve, and Gastropoda, results indicate high
   adsorption rates of Pb and Zn. The probable metal contamination in the
   Ouro River basin is from diffuse sources such as agriculture erosion
   (fertilizers and fertilizers with heavy and toxic heavy metals).},

Title = {Do Temporal and Spatial Parameters or Lifestyle of the Pacific Oyster
   <i>Crasssostrea gigas</i> Affect Pollutant Bioaccumulation, Offspring

Abstract = {This study evaluated the vulnerability of early life stages of native
   oysters (Crassostrea gigas) from the Arcachon Bay (SW, France) to
   pollutants at risk in the lagoon in particular copper and S-metolachlor.
   Developmental abnormalities in wild and cultivated oyster D-larvae were
   investigated during 2 breeding-seasons (2013 and 2014) at different
   sampling sites and dates. In addition, copper, and metolachlor
   concentrations were determined both in seawater and in mature oysters.
   Bioaccumulation of Cu was observed at higher levels in wild than in
   farmed specimens. Metolachlor was accumulated at much lower levels.
   After 24 h exposure, significant increases of the percentage of abnormal
   D-larvae were observed when exposed at 1 mu g L-1 of copper or 10 ng L-1
   of metolachlor in comparison with the controls whatever the date, the
   site, and rearing conditions of the genitors. The current study
   demonstrates that environmental concentrations of copper and metolachlor
   can induce a significant increase of developmental abnormalities in
   farmed and wild populations of oysters. However, no significant
   differences of sensitivity were observed according to temporal, spatial
   parameters, and lifestyle of genitors. In addition, oyster larvae
   obtained from the hatchery displayed the same sensitivity to pollutants
   as larvae from the field, demonstrating their suitability for toxicity
   assays and water quality monitoring.},

Abstract = {Polychlorobiphenyls, chlorinated pesticides, polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons and heavy metals ( Cd, Pb, Cr, Ni, Hg, Cu, Fe, Zn) were
   measured in the entire tissue of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis,
   collected at five sites in the Lagoon of Venice and one reference site
   outside the Lagoon, in the Adriatic Sea. Total concentrations ranged
   from 57.5 +/- 0.2 to 779 +/- 11 ng g(-1) d. w. for PAHs, from 52 +/- 4
   to 286 +/- 1 ng g(-1) d. w. for PCBs, and from 2.6 +/- 0.8 to 37 +/- 4
   ng g(-1) d. w. for pesticides, indicating significantly higher
   contamination in the central part of the Lagoon with respect to the
   northern and southern ones. As regards heavy metals, only Cd presented a
   pattern similar to that of organic compounds. The other metals showed
   peculiar distribution in the six sites of the Lagoon in relation to
   their sources. The risk to human health as a result of eating these
   mussels was evaluated by comparison of daily dietary intake with
   toxicological threshold limits. In mussels from Porto Marghera, Cd,
   hexachlorobenzene and pyrene had concentrations potentially harmful to
   human health.},

Abstract = {Levels of Pb, Zn, Cu, Cd and Hg and certain organochlorines including
   DDT and PCB {[}polychlorinated biphenyls] were determined in green
   mussels, mullets and bottom sediments of mouths of Mae Klong, Ta Chin,
   Chao Phraya and Ban Pakong Rivers {[}Thailand]. The 4 river mouths were
   contaminated by heavy metals to some extent. Pb contamination in
   mussels, mullets and sediments was obvious at values significantly
   higher than those previously reported. Contamination of the other metals
   in mussels and mullets was within acceptable limits, except for Hg in
   Chao Phraya River mouth which approached the acceptable limit.
   Organochlorines, especially DDT and its metabolites, were detectable in
   some samples of mussels, mullet and sediments. PCB were detectable in
   some samples of mussels and mullets but not in sediments. Levels of
   these organochlorines were comparable to baseline levels.},

Abstract = {study employed a suite of three biomonitors to investigate trace metal
   pollution in the Thames estuary, a region of significant clean-up of
   contaminants and the cumulative return of fauna and flora over the last
   two decades. The biomonitors chosen are the brown seaweed Fucus
   vesiculosus (bladder wrack), the barnacle Balanus I. improvisus and the
   talitrid amphipod crustacean Orchestia gammarellus, in order to obtain
   data on the bioavailabilities of Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb, Fe, Ag and Mn in the
   Thames estuary in 2001, as a basis for future comparisons as pollution
   is further reduced in the Thames. Accumulated metal concentrations in
   these organisms represent integrated records of the total
   bioavailabilities of the metals to that organism at that location over a
   previous time period, and comparisons of accumulated concentrations in a
   biomonitor between sites are indeed comparisons of the recent
   contaminant bioavailabilities to that biomonitor. All three biomonitors
   showed geographical differences in trace metal bioavailabilities along
   the Thames estuary. There was general agreement in the conclusions to be
   drawn from each of the three species used. Raised bioavailabilities of
   zinc, cadmium, lead, iron and manganese are present, particularly in the
   middle region of the Thames investigated, downstream of the effluent
   discharges of the sewage works at Beckton and Crossness.},

Abstract = {Farming of suspended mussels is important for generating high protein
   food and animal feed or for removing nutrients in eutrophic systems.
   However, the harvested mussels must not be severely contaminated by
   pollutants posing a potential health risk for the consumers. The present
   study estimated the bioaccumulation of cadmium, copper, nickel, lead and
   zinc in suspended blue mussels (Mytilus edulis L) in the Limfjorden,
   Denmark, based on observations and modelling. Modelling was used to
   assess the suitability of suspended blue mussels as animal feed and food
   products at sea water metal concentrations corresponding to Good
   Ecological Status (GES) in the European Union Water Framework Directive
   (WFD) and in future climate change scenarios (higher metal
   concentrations and higher temperatures). For this purpose, GES is
   interpreted as good chemical status for the metals using the
   Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) defined in the WFD priority
   substance daughter directives. Observations showed that suspended
   mussels were healthy with respect to metal pollution and generally less
   polluted than benthic mussels due to the smaller contact with the
   contaminated sediment. The model results showed that the WFD targets for
   Cd, Ni and Pb are not protective with respect to marine mussel
   production and probably should be reduced for marine waters. Climate
   changes may increase the metal contamination of mussels, but not to any
   critical level at the relatively unpolluted study sites. In conclusion,
   WFD targets should be revised to assure that the corresponding body
   burdens of metals in mussels are below the safety limits according to
   the EU Directives and the Norwegian classification for animal feed and
   food production. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   in Kabul River, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan},
Journal = {BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},

Abstract = {The present investigation aimed to assess the concentrations of selected
   heavy metals in water and sediments and their bioaccumulation in tissues
   of freshwater mussels and their histopathological effects on the
   digestive gland, gills, and gonads of Anodonta cygnea. Water, sediments,
   and freshwater mussel samples were collected at four sites, that is,
   reference and polluted sites, along the Kabul River, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
   The polluted sites were receiving effluents fromthe industrial,
   agricultural, municipal, and domestic sources. The order of metals in
   the water was Zn > Pb > Ni > Cu > Mn > Fe > Cr > Cd, in sediments the
   order was Fe > Zn > Cr > Ni > Mn > Pb > Cu > Cd, and in the soft tissues
   the order was Fe > Zn > Mn > Pb > Cu > Cr > Ni > Cd. Histopathological
   alterations observed in polluted sites of Kabul River were inflammation,
   hydropic vacuolation, and lipofuscin pigments (in digestive gland), gill
   lamellar fusion, dilated hemolymphatic sinus, clumping, and generation
   of cilia and hemocytic infiltration (in gills), and atresia, necrosis,
   granulocytoma, hemocytic infiltration, and lipofuscin pigments (in
   gonads). The histopathological alterations in the organs of Anodonta
   cygnea can be considered as reliable biomarkers in biomonitoring of
   heavy metal pollution in aquatic ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The accumulation levels of elements (Al, As, Li, Mg, Mn, S, Si, Ti, and
   V) in the soft tissue of mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis), collected
   monthly in 2016, from Junuary to December, from sampling sites of the
   mussel farming facilities installed in the coastal areas of Al Hoceima,
   were investigated. The studied element levels were determined by using
   Inductively Coupled Plasma - Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES
   720-ES). Descending order of the average element concentrations in soft
   tissue ofM. galloprovincialiswas S > Mg > Si> Al > Mn > Ti > As >V > Li.
   Element contents (Al, As, Mg, S and V) in tissue of mussels were
   significantly different (P < 0.05) between seasons, being highest in
   winter and lowest in summer. Strong correlations were observed between
   studied elements and chlorophylla, indicating the importance of food for
   metal bioaccumulation in mussels in this period of the season. The
   observed strong correlations for metal levels in tissues of mussels can
   be explained by their common sources, which are associated with
   anthropogenic effects. The detected seasonal variations of investigated
   element concentrations in soft tissues ofM. galloprovincialiscould be
   attributed to physicochemical parameters such as temperature, salinity,
   dissolved oxygen, nutrients and food availability, as well as the
   biological status of the mussel. This study may provide basic
   information for detecting the current pollution status of investigated
   elements in Al Hoceima coasts from the Moroccan Mediterranean Sea
   usingM. galloprovincialisas biological indicators.},

Abstract = {The concentrations of trace metals (Fe, Zn, Mn, Ni, Cu, Co and Cr) were
   determined for the first time in Mediterranean blue mussels (Mytilus
   galloprovincialis) and surface sediments. The mussel and sediment
   samples were collected from five sites on the Montenegrin coastal area
   (southeastern Adriatic Sea) in the fall of 2005 and 2006. The collected
   samples were digested with a microwave digestion system. The maximum Fe,
   Zn, Mn, Ni, Cu, Co and Cr mean concentrations in the mussel samples were
   603.0, 345.0, 85.0, 18.9, 17.2, 9.1 and 4.2 mg/kg of sample dry weight,
   respectively. The maximum Fe, Mn, Cr, Ni, Zn, Cu and Co concentrations
   in the sediment samples were 40867, 943.0, 382.0, 336.0, 67.2, 24.8 and
   16.9 mg/kg of sample dry weight, respectively. A correlation between the
   metal levels found in the mussel soft tissues with those found in
   sediments, for both 2005 and 2006, could be established, except for the
   levels of Zn observed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Consumption of <i>Ruditapes philippinarum</i> and <i>Ruditapes
   decussatus</i>: comparison of element accumulation and health risk},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {20},
Number = {8},
Pages = {5682-5691},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Ruditapes philippinarum, a species native from the Indo-Pacific region,
   was introduced in Europe at the beginning of the 1970s for culture
   purposes, leading to a massive decrease of the native species Ruditapes
   decussatus and a high increase of R. philippinarum yields in Europe.
   Bivalves can accumulate high amounts of metals and thus easily reach
   concentrations that are toxic not only to themselves but also to
   consumers. Since differences in the accumulation of pollutants may exist
   between bivalve species, different health risks may be overcome. For
   this reason, the level of metals in seafood raises public health
   concerns, and international organisations like European Food Safety
   Authority, United States Food and Drug Administration, and Food
   Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ) set maximum levels (MLs),
   above which edible seafood cannot be marketed. In order to evaluate the
   risk associated with the consumption of R. philippinarum and R.
   decussatus, both clam species were collected in the same site in Ria de
   Aveiro and the concentration of eight elements determined in organisms
   before and after a 48-h depuration period. Results evidence that even at
   low contaminated areas, the MLs for some elements can easily be
   achieved. The concentrations of As were above the reference values for
   FSANZ, and the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) is exceeded
   for As when more than 0.5 kg of R. decussatus and 0.9 kg of R.
   philippinarum clam flesh is consumed, in 1 week, by an adult (70 kg).
   When comparing with other systems worldwide, consumers of depurated
   clams from this coastal system have a similar or lower risk of exceeding
   the PTWI for Cd, As, Pb, and Hg. The recently introduced clam, R.
   philippinarum, accumulates lower amounts of the most health-threatening
   elements (less than 71 \% of Cd, 40 \% of As, and 20 \% of Hg) than the
   native R. decussatus, except for Pb. R. philippinarum also reduces more
   the element burden when subjected to depuration than R. decussatus.
   Moreover, R. philippinarum allocates a lower proportion of the
   accumulated elements in the soluble fraction, where they are readily
   available. Thus, it is safer to consume R. philippinarum than R.
   decussatus, except when clams come from areas heavily polluted by Pb.},

Abstract = {The use of bivalves such as the brown mussel (Perna perna) and the black
   mussel (Choromytilus meridionalis) is common in the study of marine
   pollution and the effect of these pollutants on ecosystems and are
   important in both economic and ecological roles. Namibian marine
   ecosystems are threatened by pollution from mining, commercial fishing
   and population growth. The aims of this study were to determine baseline
   metal concentrations, spatial variation and variation between species.
   Metal levels in C meridionalis from Guano Platform (GP) are the lowest
   of all the sites. The most polluted sites are Rocky Point (RP), Halifax
   Island (HIL) and between Walvis Bay and Swakopmund (WS). The
   bioaccumulation of metals between P. perna and C meridionalis were not
   uniform for all metals. Overall the study indicates the condition of the
   coastline to be mostly normal, with Cd and Pb levels being of concern.

Title = {Extreme variation in the concentration of trace metals in sediments and

Abstract = {Intertidal sediments and bivalves Scrobicularia plana from Bilbao
   estuary (Spain) were repeatedly sampled during and after the 1989-90
   drought. The organic content (OC) and the concentration of most of the
   10 metals analysed in sediments were extremely variable (e.g. Cd ranged
   from 4 to 112 mu g g(-1), ppm dry wt), and they were strongly related to
   an index applied to estimate the magnitude of the drought (namely the
   deficit flow of the main river). After OC normalisation, the correlation
   versus deficit was lost for some elements (Cr, Fe, Ni) but not for
   others (Cd, Co, Cu, Pb, Zn). This leads to the conclusion that both a
   natural and a man-induced process account for the observed rise and fall
   of the contamination pattern: the reduced river flow raised the
   metal-binding capacity of sediments, and restrictions in the water
   supply increased the corrosion of sewers and their leaching of some
   elements. The concentration of trace metals in local bivalves (Cd
   reached 100 and 458 ppm dry wt, respectively, for whole tissues and
   digestive gland) mirrored the sediment contamination dynamics, but at a
   slower pace. The means by which S. piano is able to tolerate such high
   Ca tissue levels remain unknown. These results constitute some prime
   field evidence of drought effects that should be born in mind when
   pollution and risk from climate change are assessed in estuaries. (C)

Abstract = {The major beds of oyster along the central-west coast of India are
   exposed to different anthropogenic activities and are severely exploited
   for human consumption. In this viewpoint, tissues of oyster Crassostrea
   madrasensis, C. gryphoides and Saccostrea cucullata were analyzed for
   Cu, Ni, Cd and Pb concentrations (dry weight) from Chicalim Bay, Nerul
   Creek and Chapora Bay in pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons.
   A higher concentration of Cu (134.4-2167.9 mg kg(-1)) and Cd (7.1-88.5
   mg kg(-1)) was found, which is greater than the recommended limits in
   all the three species (and sites). Moreover, significant (p < 0.05)
   variations were observed for all the metals concentrations among the
   species, seasons and sites. The high concentrations of Cd and Cu in
   tissues of edible oyster pose a threat to human health. Therefore,
   continuous monitoring, people awareness and a stringent government
   policy should be implemented to mitigate the metal pollution along the
   studied sites.},

Abstract = {Concentrations of metals (Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb and Zn) in the marine bivalve
   Pinna nobilis at several coastal locations of Majorca and the Cabrera
   Islands (Mediterranean Sea) were investigated. The elevated
   concentrations of metals found in the soft tissues of P. nobilis
   indicate high bioaccumulation factors. All concentrations and the
   calculated metal pollution index showed significant differences between
   sites, with particularly high concentrations in the Cabrera Archipelago,
   a marine protected area (MPA). The datasets were evaluated with the
   limited information published in the literature for Pinnidae species
   worldwide. In benthic P. nobilis, concentrations of Cd, Cu and Zn are
   more than 30 times higher and Hg and Pb concentrations are 4 and 7 times
   higher, respectively, than concentrations in other bivalve species, such
   as Mytilus galloprovincialis (Mytilidae). These observations from
   species inhabiting nearby ecological habitats of the coastal environment
   (Pinnidae vs. Mytilidae) are also discussed in the context of current
   marine monitoring strategies and assessments.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},

Abstract = {Concentrations of Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Pb, Ni, Cd, and Co in molluscan shells
   and associated surface sediments from four sites on the Gulf of Aqaba
   and Red Sea coasts, Egypt, were measured by using atomic absorption
   spectrophotometer. The results revealed an apparent difference in the
   ability of each species regarding accumulating heavy metals in its
   shell. These results showed that Tridacna squamosa has the highest
   accumulation ability for Pb, Ni, and Zn, and Chama pacifica has the
   highest accumulation capability for Co and Cd, whereas Periglypta
   reticulata has the highest accumulation ability for Cu. The results also
   showed that there is a positive correlation between the concentration of
   Cu, Zn, Pb, and Ni and the size of shell. Simultaneously, there is a
   negative correlation with Fe, Mn, Co, and Cd. The results of
   bio-accumulation of molluscan species were consistent with the
   enrichment factors for sediments, where the Hurghada site was extremely
   enriched with Pb and very enriched with Cu, Zn, and Ni. Moreover, the
   Quseir site was extremely enriched with Cd and very enriched with Pb.
   The Um al-Sid site was severe enriched with Cd and Pb. Meanwhile, the
   Ras Mohamed site was severe enriched with Pb and nearly unpolluted with
   other metals. Heavy metals can enter the studied ecosystem by
   terrigenous and anthropogenic sources as a weathering process of the
   nearby beaches and mountains, ship maintenance, industrial activities,
   wastewater, and traffic exhaust.},

Abstract = {In the present work, the concentration of eight metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe,
   Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) was determined in the sediments and transplanted and
   native mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis). The study was conducted in
   Turkish marinas, shipyards, and shipbreaking yards. The effect of metal
   pollution was evaluated by determining the levels of metallothionein
   (MT) in the mussels. The extent of contamination for each single metal
   was assessed by using the geoaccumulation index (I-geo) and enrichment
   factor (EF). Whereas, to evaluate the overall metal pollution and
   effect, the pollution load index (PLI), modified contamination degree
   (mC(d)), potential toxicity response index (RI), mean effects range
   median (ERM) quotient (m-ERM-Q), and mean PEL quotient (m-PEL-Q) were
   calculated. The influence of different background values on the
   calculations was discussed. The results indicated a significant metal
   pollution caused by Cu, Pb, and Zn especially in shipyard and
   shipbreaking sites. Higher concentrations of MT were observed in the
   ship/breaking yard samples after the transplantation.},

Title = {Trace metal contents in the mussel <i>Mytilus galloprovincialis</i> from
   Atlantic coastal areas in northwestern Morocco: Levels of contamination
   and assessment of potential risks to human health},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},

Abstract = {The bioaccumulation of trace metals Cd, Cr, Cu and Zn in soft tissues of
   the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis was studied seasonally along the
   Atlantic coast of northwestern Morocco. Average concentrations (mu g
   g(-1) dry weight) decreased in the following order: Zn (141.61 +/-
   78.06) > Cr (22.57 +/- 15.47) > Cu (18.95 +/- 20.01) > Cd (16.33 +/-
   19.01), with higher amounts during wet seasons. The ``Metal Pollution
   Index{''} and ``Individual Multimetal Bioaccumulation Index{''}
   suggested a higher mussel contamination in industrialized areas.
   Moreover, Cd and Cr concentrations were above the permissible
   guidelines' limits. The related risks to human health associated with
   mussel consumption were also assessed. The ``Target Hazard Quotient{''}
   for Cd and Cr revealed a threat to children when mussels originated from
   polluted stations, while the ``Hazard Index{''} indicated a hazard to
   them in all stations. Regarding the ``Maximum Safe Consumption{''},
   children should not consume mussels, even in low quantities. This study
   represents the first datum in Morocco to assess such a risk to human
   health.},

Abstract = {The objective of this commentary is to promote the use of bivalves as
   biomonitors, which is a part of the continual efforts of the
   International MusselWatch. This commentary is an additional discussion
   on ``Bivalve mollusks in metal pollution studies: From bioaccumulation
   to biomonitoring{''} by Zuykov et al., published in Chemosphere 93,
   201-208. The present discussion can serve as a platform for further
   insights to provide new thoughts and novel ideas on how to make better
   use of bivalves in biomonitoring studies. The certainty of better and
   more extensive applications of mollusks in environmental monitoring in
   the future is almost confirmed but more studies are urgently needed.
   With all the reported studies using bivalves as biomonitors of heavy
   metal pollution, the effectiveness of using Mussel Watch is beyond any
   reasonable doubts. The challenge is the development of more accurate
   methodologies for of heavy metal data interpretation, and the precision
   of the biomonitoring studies using bivalves as biomonitors, whether in
   coastal or freshwater ecosystems. Lastly, inclusion of human health risk
   assessment of heavy metals in commercial bivalves would make the
   research papers of high public interest.},

Title = {An assessment of two decades of trace metals monitoring in wild mussels
   from the Northwest Atlantic and Cantabrian coastal areas of Spain,

Abstract = {Since 1991, the Instituto Espanol de Oceanografia has monitored the
   concentrations of trace metals in wild mussels from the north
   (Cantabrian Sea) and northwest (Atlantic) coasts of Spain to define
   geographical distributions and temporal trends. While Cu, Zn and As
   concentrations presented fairly uniform geographical distributions, Hg
   and Pb concentrations were higher in mussels from the Cantabrian sea
   region as a result of historical anthropogenic activities. Cd, on the
   other hand, appeared to be more affected by natural processes on the
   northwest Atlantic coast (i.e., upwelling) than by human activity.
   Approximately 70\% of the paired observations showed downward trends,
   50\% of these significant, with time. An improvement in environmental
   conditions along the northern coasts of Spain is evident despite that
   some metal levels resulted above the Background Assessment
   Concentrations given by OSPAR to assess potentially harmful occurrences.

Title = {Metals in sediments and the edible cockle <i>Cerastoderma edule</i> from

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},

Abstract = {Metals (Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn) were determined over a 3-year period in
   sediments and bivalves Cerastoderma edule from two lagoon ecosystems on
   the Moroccan Atlantic coastline, Moulay Bou Selham and Sidi Moussa.
   Sediment metal concentrations were seasonally influenced, and were
   highest, generally, in winter - possibly signifying an increased
   contribution from run-off from adjacent arable land and roads. Neither
   site can be considered highly contaminated; however, Cd was enriched at
   Sidi Moussa, probably as a result of waste discharge from phosphate
   industries 20 km along the coast to the northeast. This ability to act
   as a sink for metals at distance from sources demonstrates the need for
   surveillance in these sensitive environments. Copper and Zn
   concentrations in edible cockles C. edule appear to be regulated over
   the concentration ranges currently found in lagoon sediments. In
   contrast, body burdens of Pb and, to a lesser extent Cd, reflect
   sediment levels and might be useful in future risk assessments. Metal
   concentrations Cerastoderma edule are seasonally related to the
   reproductive cycle, however, and sample timing will need to be
   standardised in future monitoring exercises. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Title = {Assessment of trace metal contamination in surficial fine-grained
   sediments and mussel, <i>Mytilus galloprovincialis</i> from Safi areas
   in the northwestern Atlantic coast of Morocco},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {During the spring season, trace metal concentrations of cadmium (Cd) and
   copper (Cu) were investigated in surficial fine-grained sediments and
   the blue mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. The study was conducted on
   the Atlantic coast of Morocco at two selected points along Safi shores,
   a supposed clean station and a recognized metal-contaminated one. The
   main objectives were to assess the pollution status of these two
   stations and to highlight the environmental and human risks associated
   with metal contamination. The bioavailability and the bioaccumulation of
   the selected metals, several physiological and biometric parameters of
   mussels were assessed at both sampling stations. As expected, the
   station located near industry plants showed the highest metal
   concentrations in the two compartments and was associated with lower
   values in the physiological and biometric indices. At the mussel scale,
   inter-station and inter-tissue variations in metal concentrations were
   observed showing a preferential accumulation within the digestive gland.
   Besides, strong reliable negative relations of Cd and Cu concentrations
   were obtained with physiological indices. Surprisingly, a significant
   occurrence of both selected metals was recorded at the location assumed
   as a reference station. Therefore, the hypothesis that this station
   presumed to be clean and currently used as a control station must be
   reconsidered. As for the risk for the consumer, the estimated daily
   intake (EDI) of Cd and Cu indicated a potential health risk through
   mussel consumption since the EDI values were markedly above the
   international guidelines and threshold levels for human consumption.
   Finally, our data were compared to those previously obtained along the
   Safi coastline (NW Morocco) and other geographical regions, including
   the Mediterranean and western Atlantic areas within the temperate zone.

Title = {Evaluation of metal pollution related to human health risk in freshwater
   snail <i>Viviparus contectus</i> (Millet, 1813) as a potential
   bioindicator species in Lake Habitat (Turkey)},

Abstract = {Freshwater mollusks are employed as bioindicators for the assessment of
   water quality in biomonitoring studies since the water quality of
   natural resources is crucial for humans. The freshwater snail species
   known as Viviparus contectus (Viviparidae: Gastropoda) is one that
   people eat. Here, the levels of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Pb, As, Zn, and
   Cu) in water and V. contectus samples were determined. An Inductively
   Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometer (ICP-AES, Spectro Arcos,
   vertical plasma) was used for the analysing the heavy metal
   concentrations in water and freshwater snail samples. The results of the
   current investigation demonstrated that freshwater snails accumulated
   metals in their water and soft tissues in the following orders: Pb > Cr
   = Zn = Cu = Cd = As and Zn > Cu > Pb > Cd > As = Cr. Autumn was the time
   of year when higher amounts of heavy metals (As, Cr, Cu, Zn, and Hg)
   were found. Pb content in the freshwater snail samples was strongly
   impacted by seasonal fluctuations (P 0.05). For adults, the EDI
   (estimated daily intake) values were lower than the TDI (tolerable daily
   intake) values, and the HI (hazard index) values were below 1.
   Freshwater snail samples had Zn and Pb levels that were over the
   FAO/WHO, Turkish Food Codex, JECFA, and EC limit values. Except for Pb,
   the water study shows mean metal concentrations below the USEPA, Turkish
   Pollution Control Regulation, and World Health Organisation maximum
   allowed levels. Aquatic ecosystems were negatively impacted by
   anthropogenic activities overall, and this study can provide a helpful
   data set for investigations on metallic contamination in water bodies
   and biomonitoring in freshwater ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The mussel fauna of many North American waters is declining, probably
   due to a combination of factors.  The factors may include channelization
   and impoundment of rivers where the mussels once thrived, as well as the
   influx of pesticides and metal pollution from surrounding watersheds. 
   Much is known about the effects of metal pollution on zooplankton and
   aquatic insects, but little is known about the response of freshwater
   mussels.  With more and more species of mussels being listed as
   threatened or endangered, it is important that we begin to determine
   their range of sensitivity to pollutants so we can better protect them. 
   Mussels have been labeled insensitive to metals because they can survive
   while containing high body burdens.  However, almost no direct
   measurement of metal toxicity has been reported for unionid mussels. 
   What little we do know has come from tests with adult mussels.  In
   response to the need for such information, a series of laboratory
   toxicity tests were performed to assess the sensitivity of Anodonta
   imbecilis to six metals, a metal-containing effluent and four metal
   mixtures.  Acute toxicity tests were performed on juvenile mussels
   reared in the laboratory.  Overall, mussels were found to be as
   sensitive to metals as zooplankton and more sensitive than commonly
   tested fish and aquatic insects.},

Abstract = {Invasive bivalve molluscs, Mediterranean mussels (Mytilus
   galloprovincialis) were used as sentinel biomonitors of pollution by
   inorganic contaminants in Saldanha Bay and the Langebaan Lagoon area of
   South Africa. Two complementary analytical techniques, ICP-MS and NAA,
   allowed for determination of concentrations of 31 major and trace
   elements including heavy metals and arsenic in the soft tissues of the
   mussels. Distinct seasonal patterns were found in the dynamics of these
   concentrations, with the mussels accumulating much more trace elements
   in winter than in the summer. In general, the mussels that grew
   naturally also demonstrated higher concentrations of As, Cd, Fe, Hg and
   Zn than those that were farmed. Fe showed the highest levels with a
   maximum concentration of 444 mg/kg followed by Zn with a maximum of 228
   mg/kg. The concentrations of Mn and Pb were significantly higher in the
   Port of Saldanha close to the jetty where ores containing these metals
   are loaded in comparison with the other sampling sites. It was concluded
   that bivalve molluscs present themselves as effective biomonitors when
   assessing marine aquatic pollution by inorganic contaminants in the
   Saldanha Bay region.},

Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},

Volume = {239},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The present study analyzed the Peruvian scallop Argopecten purpuratus
   and its food sources for metal and fatty acid concentrations in order to
   determine spatial and temporal differences. Metals such as copper (Cu),
   manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn) in gills and iron (Fe) and Zn in sediments
   were the most significant explaining factors for spatial
   differentiations (degree of contamination), while for fatty acids, it
   was C14:0, C15:0, C16:0 and C18:0 in A. purpuratus' muscle and in its
   food sources, which explained more temporal differences (El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) effect). Gills, digestive gland and
   intestine were the tissues where metal accumulation was the highest in
   A. purpuratus. Cd in digestive gland was always high, up to similar to
   250-fold higher than in other tissues, as previously reported in other
   bioindicator species for metal pollution. Fatty acids were good
   biomarkers when annual comparisons were performed, while metals when
   locations were compared. ENSO 2017 played an important role to
   disentangle A. purpuratus' biological conditions and food sources. A.
   purpuratus from Paracas locations mostly showed higher metal
   concentrations in gills and digestive glands, and lower fatty acid
   concentrations in muscle than those from Sechura and Illescas Reserved
   Zone. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study examined trends in contaminants measured during three decades
   of ``Mussel Watch{''} monitoring on the California coast. Chlorinated
   organic contaminants and butyltins declined the most rapidly, with
   tissue concentrations in 2010 that were up to 75\% lower than during the
   1980s. Silver and lead declined at about half of the stations statewide,
   but generally exhibited slower rates of decline relative to the organic
   compounds. In contrast, copper increased at many stations, and PAHs
   showed little evidence for declines. Mussels from San Francisco Bay and
   the Southern California Bight were historically the most contaminated
   and have had the steepest declines. Overall, these data show that the
   ``Mussel Watch{''} approach to monitoring contaminants in California has
   provided some of the best evidence of the effectiveness of actions to
   improve water quality over the past 30 years. These datasets also
   highlight challenges that remain in managing PAHs and copper. (C) 2013

Abstract = {This research paper focused on the monitoring of marine sites using
   mussels, which are highly valuable organisms in assessing environmental
   health. However, a significant challenge arises when determining the
   appropriate size of mussels for monitoring purposes. The objective of
   this study was to examine the levels of Cd, Pb, As, and Co in three
   different size classes of two mussel species, Mytilus galloprovincialis
   and Perna perna, collected from three sites along the Algerian coast,
   each exhibiting varying degrees of pollution.At each of the study sites,
   a total of thirty individuals from small, medium, and large size classes
   of mussels were collected during four different time periods. The
   mussels were then dissected, and the concentrations of Cd, Pb, As, and
   Co were measured in the entire flesh of the mussels using ICP-MS.Across
   the various study sites, the concentrations of cadmium, lead, arsenic,
   and cobalt ranged from 0.06 to 1.32 mg/kg, 0.09 to 12.56 mg/kg, 4.23 to
   18.31 mg/kg, and 0.11 to 1.85 mg/kg, respectively. Interestingly, the
   distribution of these metals in the three different size classes of
   mussels followed a consistent pattern at all the study sites. Large
   mussels exhibited higher concentrations, while small and medium-sized
   mussels displayed lower levels. These findings highlight substantial
   spatial and temporal variations in metal concentrations within the
   studied sites.},

Abstract = {The concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were measured in
   several soft-tissue types of the Antarctic soft-shelled clam, Laternula
   elliptica, which had been collected from Rothera Research Station,
   Adelaide Island, Antarctic Peninsula. Concentrations of Mn, Ni, Cr and
   Pb were significantly higher in the kidney than in any other soft tissue
   and highest concentrations of Cu were observed in the digestive gland.
   In general, the total tissue concentrations of heavy metals in L.
   elliptica were considered to be at baseline levels, except for Cu in
   organisms near the end of the runway. Copper concentrations were an
   order of magnitude greater (357 mug/g dry weight) than baseline levels,
   suggesting anthropogenic contamination or an unidentified natural
   source. However, there was no indication of anthropogenic metal
   contamination occurring close to the sewage outfall at Rothera, which is
   a significant metal source. The results indicate that L. elliptica is a
   useful long-term biomonitor of heavy metal contamination in Antarctic
   coastal waters.},

Abstract = {The biogeochemistry of trace metals in nearshore sediments and mussel
   was studied at 15 stations along a 1000 km long transect paralleling the
   west coast of the Gulf of California (GOC). Total trace metal (Me) and
   enrichment factor (EFMe) values in sediments were low due to negligible
   anthropogenic influence in the region. Past copper mining, however, near
   Santa Rosalia caused concentrations of Pb, Mn, Co, Zn and Cu which were
   10-3.3 x 10(3) times greater than the average for the rest of the
   transect Mussels also showed relatively high trace metal concentrations
   at the Santa Rosalia stations, but the variability in the spatial
   distribution was low and had undefined trends. Our results show that,
   with the exception of Co and Cu, the contamination caused by the copper
   mine affected sediments to a greater extent than mussels. (C) 2013

Abstract = {Seafood is increasingly used worldwide due to its nutritional value. It
   is rich in essential minerals, liposoluble vitamins, and high-quality
   proteins. However, many seafood species tend to accumulate metals,
   making them a threat to human health. We chose Xincun Lagoon and Li-an
   Lagoon, which have been seriously polluted by local activities, and the
   relatively clean Tufu Bay as the research areas to investigate whether
   trace metals in economic seafood species in these areas threaten the
   food safety of consumers. The results show that the mean concentrations
   (mg kg(-1) ww) of trace metals were Cu 0.22 +/- 0.18, Pb 0.040 +/-
   0.028, Zn 5.25 +/- 1.60, Cd 0.009 +/- 0.004, Hg 0.0072 +/- 0.0031, As
   0.21 +/- 0.12, and Cr 0.084 +/- 0.048 in fish samples (Trachinotus
   ovatus); Cu 4.00 +/- 0.96, Pb 0.075 +/- 0.030, Zn 19.10 +/- 2.64, Cd
   0.050 +/- 0.024, Hg 0.0131 +/- 0.0035, As 0.91 +/- 0.27, and Cr 0.216
   +/- 0.095 in crab samples (Charybdis natator); and Cu 5.37 +/- 1.39, Pb
   0.095 +/- 0.023, Zn 21.38 +/- 3.59, Cd 0.096 +/- 0.026, Hg 0.0208 +/-
   0.0052, As 1.65 +/- 0.59, and Cr 0.406 +/- 0.117 in bivalve samples
   (Ruditapes philippinarum), respectively, with species specific (fish <
   crab < bivalve) and significant seasonal and spatial variation (p <
   0.05). However, health risk assessment (EDI, THQ, TTHQ, CR) indicated
   that the consumption of the analyzed seafood from the study areas is
   safe for local consumers. But there is a potential risk for fishermen
   and those who prefer seafood.},

Abstract = {The estuarine channel of Vitoria Bay was evaluated regarding
   bioaccumulation of metals (Al, Ba, Mn, Fe, Zn, Cu, Cr, Pb, Ni, Cd, Hg)
   and As in mollusks. Mussels from an aquaculture farm and transplanted
   into the estuary, whereas oysters were collected in situ in the same
   area. Concentrations of Al, Mn, Fe, Cr and As were higher in P. perna,
   whereas C. rhizophorae bioaccumulated more Ba, Zn and Cu. Arsenic
   concentrations in P. perna exceeded the limit of the Brazilian
   legislation in the outer estuary. Salinity seemed to influence metal
   uptake differently for each bivalve, with P. perna absorbing more metal
   at higher salinities and C. rhizophorae in areas of lower salinity.
   Hazard index (HI) >1 revealed risk for both bivalves for high level
   consumers. Target Cancer Risk (TCR) for As revealed threat for human
   health associated with the consumption of mussels and oysters from the
   study area.},

Abstract = {The Mediterranean blue mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis was used as a
   pollution level indicator in the Boka Kotorska Bay of the southeastern
   Adriatic on the Montenegrin coast. The ever-increasing urbanization and
   industrialization, combined with a poor sewage system, an increase in
   both marine and inland traffic, as well as insufficient water
   circulation in the Bay itself have resulted in some level of pollution.
   Since heavy metals are extremely toxic and do not easily undergo
   biodecomposition, the results of this study supply valuable information
   concerning the metal pollution of the marine environment in Boka
   Kotorska Bay. The concentrations of the investigated metals and
   nonmetals accumulated in the mussels were determined during the fall of
   2007 using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) for Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu,
   Cd, Hg, Pb, Sn and V, and Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (ED-XRF)
   to determine the concentrations of Fe, Zn, Si, P, S. Cl, K and Ca.
   ED-XRF was also used to determine the levels of non-metals and elements
   present in high concentrations. Comparing the data from this study in
   relation to data from other regions for Mytilus galloprovincialis, the
   mussel sampled from the Boka Kotorska Bay showed a moderate level of
   pollution.},

Abstract = {Margaritifera margaritifera is a critically threatened species in
   Europe. Metal pollution may be one of the reasons for its decline, but
   the influence of this factor remains insufficiently studied. Zn, Cu, Ni,
   Cd, and Pb were determined in the foot tissue of the freshwater pearl
   mussel Margaritifera margaritifera (bivalvia, margaritiferidae) from
   Green Belt rivers of Fennoscandia {[}the Murmansk region (Kola
   Peninsula) and Karelia (northern part)] and the accumulation of the
   metals was shown to be variable; however, their levels in the molluscs,
   being quite long-lived aquatic organisms, do not exceed the established
   standards of the Russian Federation. The recorded levels of the metals
   in the foot tissue of the Margaritifera margaritifera can be considered
   indicators of the background levels of geologic and anthropogenic metal
   concentrations in the environment influencing the distribution and
   development of this protected species in the lake-river systems of the
   Green Belt of Fennoscandia.},

Abstract = {Sediments from three Galician Rias were tested for toxicity using
   sea-urchin and ascidian sediment elutriate embryo-larval bioassays.
   Trace metal contents in seawater, sediments and mussels were also
   determined and subjected to multidimensional scaling methods which
   grouped stations according to chemical contamination. High metal
   contents were found in seawater, sediments and mussels from the Ria of
   Pontevedra, and moderate levels were detected in the Ria of Vigo and Ria
   of Arousa. The results revealed that samples assessed as toxic,
   according to the sea-urchin and ascidian embryo-larval bioassays, were
   among the most polluted by trace metals. A good agreement was reported
   between ordination plots resulting from applying multidimensional
   scaling to the chemical data, and the results of the biological
   endpoints tested. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A 5-month experiment combining a geochemical survey of metals with a
   bioaccumulation study in batches of Crassostrea gigas was conducted in
   two shellfish farming areas and a marina in Normandy (France). Various
   endpoints at different levels of biological organization were studied.
   ROCCH data showed differences in biota contamination between the two
   shellfish areas but the present study revealed only slight differences
   in metallic contamination and biomarkers. By contrast, significantly
   different values were recorded in the marina in comparison with the two
   other sites. Indeed, higher levels of Cd, Cu and Zn were measured in the
   oysters from the marina, and these oysters also showed a poorer
   physiological condition (e.g., condition index, histopathological
   alterations and neutral lipid content). For coastal monitoring, the
   multi-biomarker approach coupled with an assessment of metallic
   contamination in biota appeared to be suitable for discriminating
   spatial differences in environmental quality after only a few months of
   exposure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The objective of the present study was to conduct a preliminary
   investigation of the pollution situation in the northern part of Vietnam
   with focus on trace elements including heavy metals. A freshwater
   bivalve species of the Unionidae family (Pletholophus swinhoei),
   abundant in this part of the country and frequently used for human
   consumption, was chosen as biomonitor. Ten specimens each were collected
   at two rural sites, Day Minh, approximately 40 km south of the capital
   Hanoi, and An Thin, situated approximately 11 km south of the Pha Lai
   power plant. The concentrations of 20 elements were measured using total
   reflection X-ray fluorescence and graphite furnace atomic absorption
   spectroscopy. Significant site-specific differences were found for the
   elements As, Ba, Be, Br, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, P and Sr. A comparison with
   other in situ biomonitoring studies using Unionidae bivalves showed that
   the concentrations of most elements were within the same order of
   magnitude, whereas heavy metal concentrations were distinctively low,
   suggesting the absence of major anthropogenic pollution sources in this
   area. The concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Se and Zn were below the
   levels regarded as harmful according to the international standards for
   metals in mollusks compiled by the Food and Agricultural Organization of
   the United Nations. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The study was conducted to assess the health risks of selected metals in
   cultured and wild Crassostrea madrasensis in Sri Lanka over 13 months.
   Metal concentrations varied monthly, and Zn and Cu concentrations
   significantly varied between cultured and wild oysters. The mean metal
   concentrations (mg kg(-1)) were accumulated in order of Zn (1220.60) >
   Mg (496.97) > Fe (356.30) > Cu (114.95) > Pb (23.20) > Cd (6.15) > As
   (3.09) > Hg (0.12). The metal concentrations were well below the
   standard guidelines given by international standards except for Pb, Cd,
   As and Zn. The weekly intakes of Hg, Cu, Fe, and Zn from C.madrasensis
   were below the Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake while Cd exceeded the
   established limit. The calculated non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk
   indices for Hg, As, Pb and Zn were within safe levels and the values for
   Cd exceeded the limit revealing carcinogenic results with long-term
   consumption. Hence, creating proper awareness and a suitable depuration
   system ensures human health and supports export-oriented markets.},

Abstract = {Concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn in the soft tissue
   of Crassostrea iridescens and the associated surface sediments (bulk and
   bioavailable metal concentrations) from an area influenced by a sewage
   outfall in Mazatlan Bay (southeast Gulf of California), were determined
   by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Significant spatial differences
   in metal concentrations in both the bulk and bioavailable forms in the
   sediments were identified. An enrichment of Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn in sites
   located on a south-north transect was detected indicating a dominant
   influence of the sewage outfall toward the north. C. iridescens
   accumulated more Zn, Cu, Ni, Fe, Cd; and less Mn, Cr and Pb than were
   bioavailable in the sediments, as measured using conventional extraction
   analysis. The degree of enrichment and the bioavailable metal
   concentrations in the sediments of the south portion of Mazatlan Bay is
   discussed. The potential ability of C. iridescens as a biomonitor of
   metallic pollutants is postulated. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {The disposal of untreated urban and industrial wastewater has a
   deleterious effect on both the water and sediment quality of Oyster Bay
   located in south Sydney, Australia. The present investigation was
   undertaken to evaluate the potential pollution of marine sediments in
   Oyster Bay. The results of metals were compared with adverse biological
   effect values effect range low (ERL) and effect range median (ERM).
   Spatial distribution of trace metals was estimated by applying
   geographic information system. The results indicated that the sediments
   were polluted with Cu, Zn, As and Pb, which exceeded ERL levels.
   However, these metals were still below ERM values, and other metals Cr
   and Ni were below ERL. Moreover, the highest concentrations of metals
   were around discharge points and in the inner bay. Further, trace metals
   could be attributed to human activities within the bay as they declined
   in concentrations with increasing sediment depth.},

Abstract = {In this study, levels of 20 trace elements (Al, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co,
   Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Ag, Cd, Sn, Sb, Ba, Hg, Pb and U) and the respective
   biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAF) were assessed for three
   marine species from the Eastern Mediterranean (Lebanese coast) belonging
   to different trophic levels in the food chain (algae, bivalves and
   shrimps). Multivariate analyses showed significant differences in trace
   element accumulation between seasons, sites and species thus
   highlighting the importance of a multi-species and seasonal approach to
   monitor trace metals in coastal areas. Biotasediment accumulation
   factors (BSAF) showed limited transfer from sediments to marine
   organisms suggesting that the bioaccumulation of trace elements by
   marine organisms should be assessed by considering multiple sources of
   contaminants. Lead (Pb) levels (0.07-4.44 mg.kg(-1)) measured in algae
   and Cd (0.54-7.74 mg.kg(-1)) and Zn (42.88-972 mg.kg(-1)) levels found
   in the oyster, were similar and sometimes higher than those found in
   other polluted areas indicating that the Lebanese coast is subject to
   environmental pollution. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Following a series of international conferences on pollution of the
   North Sea, the UK Government committed itself in 1990 to reducing the
   inputs of certain dangerous substances reaching the aqueous environment
   from point and diffuse sources. The target was a 50\% reduction in
   loadings over the period 1985-95. Metals loadings from rivers and sewage
   works to the Clyde Sea Area are presented for the period 1990-97. These
   are compared to trace metals body burdens in mussels collected from
   shores throughout the Clyde Sea Area over the period 1980-97.
   For most metals, no clear trend either increasing or decreasing was
   observed in metals loadings from point sources or in mussel body
   burdens. The exceptions were cadmium, which showed downward trends with
   time in loadings and in concentrations in Clyde Estuary mussels, and
   lead, which showed a downward trend in mussel concentrations.
   Metals loadings from point sources may have reached baseline levels,
   below which further reductions will be difficult to achieve. Elevated
   mussel body burdens of specific metals provided good evidence that some
   shores are severely affected by point source inputs, others by bulk
   contamination from far-field point sources, and others by diffuse
   sources of metals. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf

Abstract = {The Manila clam is emerging as a relevant species for the Portuguese
   market. The present work was conducted in the Tagus estuary to evaluate
   1) the metals and As content in the sediments of the Tagus estuary,
   especially on those areas subjected to Manila clam harvesting 2) the
   metals and As content in clams, and the risk associated with their
   consumption 3) the physiological and biochemical responses of the clam
   to metals and As contamination, and its possible role as a pollution
   bioindicator in the estuarine environment. The most contaminated
   sediments were identified nearby industrial areas, nevertheless clams
   collected in low contaminated areas showed high metals and As
   concentrations. The condition index, glycogen content, membrane
   oxidative damage, biotransformation enzymes and metallothioneins showed
   consistent responses to metals and As content in clams. Results
   emphasize the need for the development of a management plan for the
   species exploitation in the Tagus estuary.},

Abstract = {Seasonal variations of tracemetal concentrations (Hg, Cd, Pb, Cr, Zn,
   and Cu) were investigated in the hepatopancreas and soft tissues
   (remaining parts of bivalves such as gill, mantle, foot, and muscle) of
   Tapes decussatus and Mytilus galloprovincialis from theHomaLagoon. The
   highest metal concentrations were recorded frequently in February and
   July in M. galloprovincialis and T. decussatus, respectively. Tracemetal
   levels (exceptZn) in the hepatopancreaswere higher than those in soft
   tissue for both bivalves. The results showed that the mean
   concentrations of Hg, Cd, and Zn for M. galloprovincialis were higher
   compared to T. decussatus in both tissues. The metal concentrations in
   both bivalves from the Homa Lagoon were generally below the values of
   provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) estimates, in terms of human
   health risk. According to hazardquotient(HQ), Crvalues
   forbothspeciesandCdvalues for only M. galloprovincialis were found
   greater than one. Also, total hazard index (THI) values were greater
   than one in both bivalves, having a potential risk for consumers.},

Title = {Use of whole mussels and mussel gills in metal pollution biomonitoring},

Abstract = {The use of marine bivalves in metal pollution monitoring is undoubtedly
   one of the best tools to evaluate metal pollution in coastal areas
   worldwide. However, since bivalves integrate metal pollution from both
   the dissolved and the particulate phases, it cannot be assured that
   metal bioaccumulation in their tissues will predict the risk posed by
   metals to sensitive organisms such as invertebrate larvae or microalgae,
   which are known to be mainly affected by the free metal ion fraction.
   This study aims to test the usefulness of mussel gills-the primary
   exchange surfaces with dissolved metals-in reflecting dissolved metal
   bioavailability in the field. For that, we analyzed metal concentrations
   in environmental samples (whole soft tissues of mussels, mussel gills,
   sediment, and particulate and dissolved fractions in the water column)
   collected from 7 sampling sites during a multi-year investigative
   monitoring survey in the Ria de Vigo. The results showed a different
   pattern of Cu and Zn accumulation in gills compared to whole soft
   tissues, and these differences are attributable to the faster response
   of gills to changes in dissolved metal concentrations and to the
   regulation of essential metals at the whole body level. In the case of
   Pb, by contrast, concentrations in gills were very similar to those in
   the whole body. The use of mussel gills in metal pollution biomonitoring
   is a promising tool for the detection of changes in bioavailable metals
   in the environment, especially for essential metals such as Cu and Zn.},

Abstract = {Specimens of mussels species Anodonta anatina, Unio pictorum, U. tumidus
   and surfical sediment samples were collected in the summers of 1994 and
   1995 from twelve lakes in the Danube Delta, Romania. Whole mussel
   tissues were analyzed for metals (Ag, As, Cd, Co, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, Se and
   Zn), and sediment samples were subjected to weak acid extraction and to
   a sequential extraction procedure, and analyzed for Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn.
   Total mean Cu and Ag concentrations were statistically greater in Unio
   species than in Anodonta species, but other metal levels did not
   significantly differ between mussel species. There was a ten fold
   variation for Cd and Pb and five fold variation for Zn, Ag and Co
   concentrations in mussels among lakes. Mean concentrations of As, Cu, Se
   and Zn in mussel tissues varied two fold among lakes. Zn, Co and Cd
   concentrations in mussels were significantly negatively correlated with
   distance gradients from the origin of the Delta and with distance from
   main channels of the Danube. Other metal concentrations in mussels did
   not correlate with either distance gradient. Trace metal levels in
   mussel tissues were correlated with those in weak acid and in sequential
   extractions of sediment. Zn concentrations in the carbonate fraction was
   the best predictor of Zn concentrations in mussels. Cu and Ni levels in
   the organic matter and sulfide fraction were the best estimators of Cu
   and Ni concentrations in mussels.},

Abstract = {In recent years, elevated metal discharges have seriously affected the
   health of many estuarine ecosystems in China. This study examined the
   influences of metal pollution on the growth and reproduction of razor
   clam, Sinonovacula constricta. An eight-month field experiment was
   conducted at two sites with different contamination levels inliulong
   River Estuary of Southern China. Concentrations of Ag, As, Cd, Cr, Cu,
   Ni, Pb and Zn in seawater, suspended particles, surface sediments, and
   clams, as well as the clam growth and gonad condition were
   simultaneously determined on a monthly basis. Over the 8-month period,
   Ag, Cu and Ni concentrations in the clams were significantly higher at
   the more polluted site, whereas the concentrations of other metals were
   rather comparable between the two sites. Comparison of the 3-month
   pattern of metal concentrations among different compartments suggested
   that Ag, As, Cd, Cu and Zn bioaccumulation in the clams was mainly
   derived from ingestion of suspended particles, whereas Cr and Ni
   accumulation was mainly from the waterborne uptake. The growth of clams
   in the more polluted site was depressed and there was no significant
   growth after 4 months of transplantation, which was mainly caused by Cu
   and Ag accumulation in the clam tissues. Correspondingly, the gonad
   somatic index was also lower at the more polluted site. Our study
   demonstrated a significant impact of multi-metal pollution on the growth
   and reproduction of clams in an estuary. Simultaneous measurements of
   metal bioaccumulation were important for the interpretation of metal
   toxicity observed in the field. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Resuspension of surficial sediments is considered a key process
   influencing bioaccumulation of metals in filter-feeders in the
   contaminated Sydney Harbour estuary (Australia). However, previous
   investigations were unable to establish a significant relationship
   between metals in sediments or suspended particulate matter (SPM) and
   oyster tissue concentrations. This study used a 60-d laboratory mesocosm
   experiment to expose Sydney rock oysters, Saccostrea glomerata, to a
   natural range of SPM concentrations with different SPM-metal
   concentrations. Dissolved metal concentrations were low and the
   availability of algae provided as food was constant for all treatments.
   Tissue metal concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn increased significantly,
   however, no relationship was determined between tissue metal
   concentrations in the oyster and either SPM or SPM-metal concentrations.
   The results indicated that exposure to resuspended contaminated sediment
   particles contributed little to the observed metal uptake. Dissolved or
   algae food sources appear to be more important for metal accumulation in
   these oysters. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Industrial and domestic discharge into the coastal environment has
   driven us to propose an integrated approach to delineate stations
   contaminated with metals on the Parangipettai coast by collecting
   sediment and seawater samples monthly at 18 stations from 2015 to 2017.
   Descriptive statistics revealed that the concentrations of some metals
   in the sediment and seawater samples were beyond the permissible level.
   Further, factor analysis showed a sampling adequacy of 0.90 with high
   positive loading for Ni (0.94), Cd (0.91), Co (0.90), Pb (0.89), and Zn
   (0.87) in sediment samples. The degree of contamination by metals was
   evaluated using pollution indices. The results of the contamination
   index revealed that some stations in the study area were moderately
   polluted, and those of the ecological index showed that open sea was
   under low risk while other stations were in the moderate-to-high-risk
   category. The results obtained are essential to establish the reference
   condition for a comparative study in similar environments in the
   tropical regions.},

Abstract = {Anadara granosa is a bivalve blood cockle occurring abundantly in
   tropical estuarine intertidal sediments. The accumulation of Cd, Zn and
   Fe and their partitioning at the sub-cellular level in the cytosol has
   been investigated in the gills, digestive gland, body and foot of A.
   granosa from seven estuaries in the Gulf of Thailand. Cadmium and Zn
   were bioaccumulated predominantly in the gills with smaller
   concentrations distributed equally throughout the other tissues. Iron
   was present at relatively low concentrations in gills but was higher,
   and more evenly distributed, in the digestive gland, body and foot. The
   concentrations of metallothionein-like protein (MTLP) were found to be
   in the range 1-11mgg(-1) (dry weight) with the highest values being in
   the digestive gland at all sites. Partitioning of the metals in the
   cytosols between low molecular weight (LMW) compounds, MTLP and high
   molecular weight compounds (HMW) indicated that 16-39\% of total Cd,
   6.5-15\% of total Fe and <6\% of total Zn were bound with MTLP. However,
   23-27\% of total Zn was bound with the HMW fraction, ascribed
   potentially to its association with the blood pigment haemoglobin (Hb).
   The metal-handling strategy, involving Zn, is likely important to blood
   cockles in supporting their uptake of dissolved oxygen in
   under-saturated tropical waters.},

Abstract = {Suspended particulate matter (SPM), sediments and clams were collected
   at three sites in Jiaozhou Bay to assess the magnitude of trace metal
   pollution in the area. Metal concentrations in SPM (Cu: 40.11-203; Zn:
   118-447; Pb: 50.1-132; Cd: 0.55-4.39; Cr: 147.6-288; Mn: 762-1670 mu
   g/g), sediments (Cu: 17.64-34.26; Zn: 80.79-110; Pb: 24.57-49.59; Cd:
   0.099-0.324; Cr: 41.6-88.1; Mn: 343-520 mu g/g) and bivalves (Cu:
   6.41-19.76; Zn: 35.5-85.5; Pb: 0.31-1.01; Cd: 0.51-0.67; Mn: 27.45-67.6
   mu g/g) are comparable to those reported for other moderately polluted
   world environments. SPM showed a less clear pattern. Metal
   concentrations in sediments displayed a clear geographical trend with
   values increasing with proximity to major urban centers. The clams (on
   dry weight) showed a complex pattern due to the variability introduced
   by age-related factors. Cd showed an apparent reverse industrial trend
   with higher concentrations in clams collected at distant stations. Zn,
   Pb and Mn showed no clear geographical pattern, whereas Cu increased in
   the clams collected in the most industrialized area. In addition, the
   bioaccumulation factors (BAF) were calculated. The result indicated that
   the studied Ruditapes philippinarum in Jiaozhou Bay possessed different
   bioaccumulation capacities for Cd, Zn, Cu, Pb and Mn, and Cd, Zn had a
   relatively high assimilation of those metals from sediment particles. A
   significant relationship with clam age was observed for Zn (positive)
   and Cu (negative) suggesting different physiological requirements for
   both metals with age. Trace metal concentrations measured in the tissue
   of the investigated clam were in the range considered safe by the WHO
   for human use.},

Abstract = {Accumulation of Cu and Ag by soft tissues of the deposit-feeding clam M.
   balthica was less than half in clams transplanted to a contaminated area
   than in clams native to that area. During a period of tissue growth, the
   transplants retained 50\% and 90\%, respectively, of the net Cu and Ag
   accumulated, but loss of metals from soft tissue by the resident
   population equalled net accumulation. Cu accumulation in the transplants
   did not occur during some periods when increases in the metal body 
   burden of the resident population indicated that environmental exposures
   were high. The difference in metal accumulation of the 2 groups of clams
   may be the result of past environmental exposures. The results
   illustrate some limitations of using transplants as indicators of
   pollution events or of pollutant impact upon resident populations.},

Abstract = {This survey was conducted to determine metal concentrations in the
   biomonitor organism Mytilus galloprovincialis collected from all coasts
   of Turkey. Naturally-occurring mussels were gathered along the coast of
   the Black Sea, Sea of Marmara, Bosphorus and Aegean Sea, while a 6-month
   transplantation session was implemented on the Levantine Sea coast where
   M. galloprovincialis does not adapt naturally. Mussels collected from
   the Izmir area were employed for transplantation to five locations along
   the Levantine Sea coast of Turkey. Concentrations of Ag, Al, As, Cd, Co,
   Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sn, V, and Zn were measured using ICP-MS
   (Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry). Results showed that
   concentrations of some essential elements (Co, Fe, K, Mn, Zn) generally
   fell within the range of acceptable global values. However, at some
   sampling sites the metal concentrations were found at higher levels
   compared to the world average and recommended limits. For instance, very
   high Ag and Cu concentrations were observed in mussel caged at
   Yumurtalik. Elevated As, Ni, Pb, and V concentrations were observed at
   the Tirebolu, Eskihisar, and Tekirdag locations, respectively. Taking
   into account all measured metals, it can be inferred that Yumurtalik is
   the most metal-contaminated locality. The results highlighted
   metal-specific pollution at coastal areas in each sea cover Turkey. In
   spite of the high metal levels estimated daily intakes (EDI) of the
   measured elements were well below through very low mussel consumption by
   Turkish public. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   studied for grain size, organic carbon, total and bioavailable metals
   (Fe, Mn, Zn, Pb) to evaluate the metal enrichment and pollution, along
   with the bioaccumulation of metals by edible bivalve Polymesoda erosa to
   understand the toxicity of metals. The distribution of metals varied
   between middle and upper estuary and was attributed to difference in
   metal source, hydrodynamics and/or post-depositional behavior. The
   pollution indices viz., contamination factor and pollution load index
   revealed metal pollution at both middle and upper estuary. Speciation of
   Mn, Zn and Pb indicated their bioavailability in sediments, and the
   application of screening quick reference table and risk assessment code
   suggested possible harmful effects of Mn on biota. The concentration of
   metals in Polymesoda erosa was more than the standard permissible limit,
   at both middle and upper estuary indicating metal toxicity to Polymesoda
   erosa and human health.},

Abstract = {A large number of white hard clam farms are in the estuary shoreline of
   Saigon-Dongnai Rivers, which flow through Ho Chi Minh City, a megacity,
   and numerous industrial zones in the basin catchment area. In this
   study, eleven trace elements (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Cd, Hg,
   and Pb) in the hard clam Meretrix lyrata and its habitats including
   surface water, suspended particulate matter, and sediment were evaluated
   to understand the bioaccumulation of trace metals from the environment
   into the whole tissues of the hard clam as well as its different organs.
   The samples were collected monthly in dry, transition, and wet seasons
   of the southern part of Vietnam from March to September 2016. The
   results showed that seasonal and spatial variations of the studied metal
   concentrations in the hard clam M. lyrata might be influenced by the sea
   current as well as the surface runoff in the rainy season. The
   relationship between condition index and the element concentrations in
   M. lyrata might be affected by the living environment conditions and
   farming methods. In addition, the hazard index values of all trace
   elements in the hard clam M. lyrata harvested in the sampling time show
   that the hard clams farmed in the study area were safe for local
   consumers.},

Title = {Human health risk assessment of metals and arsenic via consumption of
   commercial bivalves in the Gulf of California, Mexico},

Abstract = {Although various studies have reported the bioaccumulation of metals in
   bivalves of commercial interest from the Gulf of California (GC), the
   risk associated with their consumption remains poorly understood. In
   this study, our own and bibliographic concentrations of 14 elements in
   16 species of bivalves from 23 locations were used to investigate (1)
   the species-specific and regional accumulation of metals and arsenic in
   bivalves, (2) the human health risks by age and sex, and (3) the maximum
   allowable consumption rates (CRlim). The assessments were done according
   to the US Environmental Protection Agency guidelines. The results
   indicate that the bioaccumulation of elements varies markedly between
   groups (oysters > mussels > clams) and localities (higher on Sinaloa due
   to intense anthropogenic activities). However, consuming bivalves from
   the GC remains safe for human health. To prevent health effects for
   residents or consumers on the GC, we recommend (1) following the CRlim
   proposed herein; (2) monitoring levels of Cd, Pb, and As (inorganic) in
   bivalves, as the elements of top concern, mainly when are consumed by
   children; (3) calculating CRlim for more species and locations,
   including at least: As, Al, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, and Zn; and (4)
   determine the regional consumption rates of bivalves.},

Abstract = {Trace metal pollution was studied in water, sediment and three selected
   bivalves in Mandovi and Chapora estuaries of Goa. The trace metal in
   water and sediment of Mandovi was higher than in Chapora. The
   concentration in the tissues was in the range of 1205.2-2506.7 ppm for
   Paphia malabarica, 1906.2-2802.6 ppm for Perna viridis and 778.7-1607.5
   ppm for Saccostrea cucullata in Mandovi estuary. Tha values for Chapora
   were 199.4-625.8 ppm for P. malabarica, 812.6-1220.2 for P. viridis and
   392.5-418.6 ppm for S. cucullata. The anthropogenic input of metal in
   Mandovi estuary appears to be mainly responsible for the high
   accumulation of trace metals. These bivalves have potential to serve as
   indicator for metal contamination in seafood of Goa. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {Metal concentrations were determined in surface sediments and
   transplanted mussels in a shallow semi-enclosed bay, Pagassitikos Gulf,
   Aegean Sea. Cu, Zn, Pb, Hg, and As levels in sediments were enriched
   close to point sources of pollution, i.e., Volos Port and cement plant.
   Fe, Mn, Cr, and Ni spatial distributions in sediments were rather
   uniform with increasing concentrations towards deeper sites, suggesting
   natural enrichment, whereas levels found in the port, although elevated,
   were not the highest in the study area. Spatial variations in
   concentrations of most metals in mussels transplanted nearshore were
   generally in accordance to those in sediments, with the highest Fe, Mn,
   Cr, Ni, and Cu levels in the port and the highest Hg levels close to the
   cement plant. Concentrations of metals in sediments and transplanted
   mussels were comparable to those reported in Mediterranean areas.
   Results indicate that pollution point sources contribute to
   anthropogenic metal enrichment in the study area.},

Abstract = {With the objective of estimating the temporal variation and
   bioavailability of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn in Coatzacoalcos estuary, the
   biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAF) were calculated. For this
   purpose, surficial sediments and clams from 14 selected sites were
   collected during three climatic seasons. In surficial sediments, highest
   levels of Cd and Cu were measured during the rainy season near to the
   industrial area of Minatitlan, while highest concentrations of Pb and Zn
   were registered during the windy season in sediments collected near to
   the industrial area of Coatzacoalcos. Considering all the sampling
   seasons and bivalve species, average metal concentrations followed the
   order Zn>Cu>Cd>Pb. BSAF ranged from 0.01 (Pb) in Corbicula fluminea
   during the hot season to 25.1 (Cd) in Polymesoda caroliniana during the
   windy season. BSAF of Cd, Cu and Zn were higher during the windy season;
   in the case of Pb, the dry season was the time when such figure was more
   elevated. It can be stated that Polymesoda caroliniana is a net
   accumulator of Cd and Zn and a weak accumulator of Pb for the studied
   estuary.},

Title = {Use of limpets as alternative to mussels in metal pollution monitoring;
   application in the Canary Islands},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Metal pollution monitoring programs make use of organisms, such as
   mussels, as biomonitors to evaluate and compare the metal pollution
   status of coastal areas worldwide. Despite the widespread distribution
   of mussels of the genus Mytilus, there are places where these organisms
   are absent or where their abundance is insufficient for biomonitoring
   purposes, such as in the Canary Islands (Spain). This study considers
   the use of limpets of the genus Patella as alternative/complementary
   species in metal pollution monitoring, and compares the bioaccumulation
   capacity of mussels and limpets collected simultaneously during several
   sampling campaigns at 11 sampling sites along the continental Spanish
   Atlantic coastline. Results show that there are some differences in
   bioaccumulation capacity between limpets and mussels, with limpets
   showing in average higher concentrations of Cd, Cr, Ni, As and Cu, and
   lower concentrations of Zn, while concentrations of Hg and Pb were
   similar for both types of organisms. Significant correlations between
   metal concentration in mussels and limpets were found for most metals,
   with the notable exception of Cd, that showed a very different
   bioaccumulation pattern in both types of organisms. Limpet to mussel
   metal concentration ratios were derived that can be used to compare the
   results of metal biomonitoring using either limpets or mussels, and
   limpets were successfully used in a monitoring survey in the Canary
   Islands.},

Abstract = {The study of microplastics (MPs) and associated pollutants is essential
   for a better understanding of some of the factors that threaten marine
   ecosystems. The main objective of this study was thus to assess Pb
   distribution and accumulation in the tissues of blue crabs (Callinectes
   sapidus) exposed to MPs. Blue crabs were collected from the mouth of the
   river Segura (Guardamar, Spain) and fed on mussels from two
   Mediterranean areas with different levels of Pb contamination: Portman
   Bay and San Pedro del Pinatar (Murcia, Spain). In addition, a batch of
   each group were exposed to MPs. After seven days of exposure, the crabs
   were euthanised, and tissues and faeces were analysed. The
   hepatopancreas was found to be the best tissue for measuring Pb
   concentrations after feeding; muscle tissue did not provide information
   on environmental quality. The meat (muscle) consumption of blue crabs
   from zones with high Pb content does not seem to constitute a risk for
   consumers, although the risk is not totally negated if all soft tissues
   are ingested. The presence of MPs in the water does not seem to increase
   the accumulation of Pb in these tissues of C. sapidus.},

Abstract = {Cd, Cu and Zn content in sediments and bivalves ( Limnoperna fortunei
   and Corbicula fluminea) were studied in the lower 500 km stretch of the
   Parana River and in the right margin of the Rio de la Plata Estuary.
   Both bivalves species showed higher metal contents at the Parana River,
   possibly related to water chemistry. The Parana water is circumneutral
   and soft, while the Rio de la Plata coastal water is alkaline, hard,
   with a higher organic content. Bivalves sampled at the thermal effluent
   of the Atucha Nuclear Power Plant, at the Parana River, showed the
   highest metal content, either from increased absorption at the higher
   water temperatures (12 degrees C higher than the river water) or from
   metal corrosion of the power plant cooling system. L. fortunei and C.
   fluminea appeared to be successful biomonitor organisms for Cd pollution
   in the basin, while Cu and Zn content in bivalve tissues was apparently
   not related to metal load.},

Abstract = {The soft tissue of Mytilus californianus has the capacity to decrease
   its Cd concentration in the order of' clays. However, for medium-term
   (months) Pollution surveys it is necessary to find alternative
   structures capable of integrating Cd concentrations during longer
   periods of time. The recently deposited nacreous layer of the shell of
   M. californianus is proposed as Such a structure. Daily variability of
   Cd concentration in the Soft tissue and in the recently deposited
   nacreous layer of a natural population Of mussels was compared during a
   period of 26 days in organisms collected from an upwelling zone of
   British Columbia. Statistical analysis of the Cd concentrations
   indicated that the nacreous layer presented less significant differences
   between days than the associated soft tissue. Only one shell sample
   showed significant differences in Cd concentrations, probably related to
   environmental conditions and stress arising from Mussel population
   density. Experimental results carried out in the laboratory confirmed
   that the recently deposited nacreous layer of M. californianus is a
   better medium-term indicator of Cd in seawater, especially at low
   concentration exposures of this element, those similar to the ones
   encountered in natural environments. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Artificial mussels as indicators of metal pollution in freshwater
   systems: A field evaluation in the Koekemoer Spruit, South Africa},

Abstract = {There has been a recent increase in water quality problems in South
   Africa. The monitoring of water resources is important for the continued
   management of water resources. The use of artificial mussels (AMs) as
   passive sampling devices in the monitoring of metals within a freshwater
   system was evaluated in a recent field study. Correlation testing was
   conducted between the AMs and Melanoides tuberculate for As, Cd, Cr, Co,
   Cu, Pb, Mn, Ni, U, V and Zn. It was found that a positive significant
   correlation exists between AMs and M. tuberculate with regards to As, U,
   and Co accumulations. The trend of metal accumulation between AMs and M.
   tuberculate were found to be similar for all of the metals tested. Site
   2 which is located close to a gold mine, was found to have the highest
   metal concentrations in this study. This study confirms the hypothesis
   that AMs can be used as a useful tool for monitoring metals in
   freshwater. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Concentrations of heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn) were determined in
   soft tissue of 122 rock oyster (Saccostrea cucullata) collected at seven
   stations from the coastal zones of Qeshm Island. The exposure of the
   consumer is compared directly to maximum residue level and provisional
   maximum tolerable daily intake. Result indicated that levels of Cd, Pb,
   and Cu were within limits, but the level of Zn exceeded that the limit.
   Concentrations of Zn (1168.71g g(-1)) and Cu (105.16g g(-1)) were
   comparatively higher than the level recommended in the international
   food standards, such as Brazilian Ministry of Health, National Health
   Medical Research Council, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,
   and the Tasmania Public Health Regulation. The results, therefore,
   indicate possible risk in consuming the oysters.},

Abstract = {Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn concentrations were measured in oysters (C.
   gigas), plankton, and seawater during spring, summer, and autumn in
   Liaodong Bay (Bohai Sea, China) to elucidate the effects of season,
   region, and oyster size on metal bioaccumulation in oysters. Metal
   concentrations were quantified via atomic absorption spectrophotometry.
   Our study determined that metal concentrations in oysters, plankton, and
   seawater were the highest in summer, whereas the lowest levels occurred
   in autumn. Regarding oyster sizes, the highest Pb levels occurred in
   C3-sized oysters (> 5-cm length), whereas the highest Cd, Cr, Cu, and Zn
   levels occurred in C2 (3-5-cm length) oysters. In contrast, the lowest
   Cu and Pb levels occurred in C1 (< 3-cm length) oysters, whereas the
   lowest mean Cd, Cr, and Zn concentrations were observed in C3 oysters.
   Significant differences in trace metal concentrations in the three
   sample types were observed in all sampling sites.},

Title = {Assessing Impacts of Metallic Contamination along the Tidal Gradient of
   a Riverine Mangrove: Multi-metal Bioaccumulation and Biomagnification of
   Filter-Feeding Bivalves},

Abstract = {Most riverine mangroves (characterized by salinity fluctuations and
   tidal inundations), are seriously threatened by metallic pollution.
   Whether differences in salinity and tidal effects along the river
   continuum can affect metallic bioaccumulation and the biomagnification
   of species is still unknown. Bivalves are representative sessile
   inhabitants in mangrove ecosystems, with a high capacity to
   bioaccumulate metallic contaminants. The present study used two
   bivalves,Meretrix lusoriaandMytilopsis sallei, to monitor inter-site
   changes in metallic contamination and assess the associated ecological
   impacts along the tidal gradients of riverine mangroves. The
   concentrations of a total of six metals (Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb) inM.
   lusoriaandM. sallei, collected at three different sites along Danshuei
   Riverine Mangrove, were investigated. The metallic concentrations of the
   whole soft body of the studied bivalves, and the associated surface
   sediment from each site, were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma
   mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to determine the inter-site effects on the
   bioaccumulation and biomagnification of metallic contaminants in
   bivalves. There are increasing concentrations of four metallic
   contaminants, Zn, Cr, Cd and Cu, in the seaward direction of the
   bivalves. The increasing mean metallic concentrations along the seaward
   direction may be the effect of salinity, further decreasing the rate of
   the elimination of these metals, thus resulting in a net increase in
   metallic contaminants. Our results clearly show prominent inter-site
   changes in the metallic burdens of bivalves in our study on riverine
   mangrove ecosystems associated with different levels of bioaccumulation
   and biomagnification of metallic contaminants. Thus, it is important to
   monitor multiple sites along the dynamic environment of riverine
   mangroves in order to gain a good understanding of the ecological impact
   of metallic pollution risks. The present findings provide important
   evidence of the use of simple indices to assess the ecological impacts
   of metallic pollution in riverine mangroves.},

Abstract = {Vanadium and nickel are two important indicators of oil pollution.
   Lengthy exposure to these elements causes serious harmful effects in
   human health, different harsh allergies being examples. The accumulation
   of two heavy metals (Ni and V) in sediment and the soft and hard tissues
   of Saccostrea cucullata were analyzed at three sampling sites along the
   coast of Lengeh Port, Persian Gulf. Results indicated at all the
   sampling sites; the Ni levels in soft tissues (STs) were higher than in
   the shells (SHs) and sediments, whereas the V levels were higher in the
   sediments. In addition, meaningful relationship (r = 0.65; p < 0.05) was
   observed across Ni levels in ST of S. cucullata and sediment, while for
   V concentrations a strong relationship (r = 0.83; p < 0.01) was found in
   SH of S. cucullata and sediment. This indicates that ST and SH of oyster
   can be considered as a biomonitoring agent for Ni and V levels, in
   coastal waters, respectively. The exposure of the consumer is compared
   directly to minimal risk level and provisional maximum tolerable daily
   intake. Result indicated that levels of Ni and V were within the safety
   limits for human consumption.},

Abstract = {Soils in New Caledonia are particularly rich in metals among which Fe
   and Ni are intensively exploited. Due to important natural erosion in
   tropical latitudes and to mining activities, coastal waters are enriched
   in Co, Cr, Fe and Ni, In deeper waters lives a cephalopod species which
   is considered as a living fossil, the nautilus Nautilas macromphalus. In
   this study, 12 trace elements were analysed in the tissues of 4 nautilus
   specimens. Results showed high metal concentrations compared to data
   available for cephalopods from temperate waters. These concentrations
   were often in the same order as those encountered in bivalves or
   gastropods from contaminated areas. Relatively high concentrations of Ni
   and Cr in the haemolymph strongly suggest a high exposure of N.
   macromphalus to these metals. Among the tissues, the digestive gland has
   the highest concentrations of Cd, Co, Fe, V and Zn while for Ag, Al, As,
   Cr and Ni, renal and pericardial appendages exhibited the highest
   values. Despite this, the digestive gland contained the largest
   quantities of all metals with the exception of As and Mn which were
   mainly found in the body muscular remains. These results highlighted the
   major role of digestive gland and excreting organs in the metabolism of
   metals in these cephalopod species. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {The current study aimed to examine the relationship between metals in
   sediments and metal bioaccumulation in oyster tissue in a
   highly-modified estuary (Sydney estuary, Australia). While extensive
   metal contamination was observed in surficial sediments, suspended
   particulate matter and oyster tissue, a significant relationship between
   these media could not be established. No relationship was determined
   between sediment quality guidelines and oyster size or weight, nor with
   human consumption levels for metals in oyster tissue. Moreover, oyster
   tissue metal concentrations varied greatly at a single locality over
   temporal scales of years. Oyster tissue at all 19 study sites exceeded
   consumptions levels for Cu. Bioaccumulation of metals in oyster tissue
   is a useful dynamic indicator of anthropogenic influence within
   estuaries, however oysters cannot be used in Sydney estuary as a valid
   biomonitor due to overriding internal regulation (homoestasis) by the
   animal, or by external natural (sediment resuspension) and anthropogenic
   (sewer/stormwater discharges) pressures, or both. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {In a preliminary biomonitoring study, accumulated trace metal
   concentrations (Cu, Zn, Fe, Cd, Pb, Mn, Ni) have been measured in the
   mussel Mytilus trossulus and the barnacle Balanus improvisus collected
   in the Gulf of Gdansk, Poland in 1998. Mussels were collected From five
   sites in May 1998, and from one site in each of January and February
   1998. Barnacles were collected simultaneously from four of the five
   sites in May 1998. Analysis of covariance has shown significant
   geographical and temporal differences in the local bioavailabilities of
   trace metals to mussels and barnacles, as reflected in the
   concentrations of accumulated trace metals. It is concluded that the
   mussel and barnacle are suitable biomonitors to employ in programmes
   designed to assess changes in metal pollution in the Gulf of Gdansk, one
   of the most metal polluted parts of the Baltic Sea; due to the outflow
   of the River Vistula. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The bioavailability of metals (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Co and Ni) in sediment
   cores (K-1, K-2, K-3 and K-4) and bioaccumulation in edible bivalves
   were studied to determine the toxicity of metals in the Kali Estuary,
   India. Enrichment Factor (EF) construed anthropogenic sources of Zn, Co
   and Ni, while Geo-accumulation Index (Igeo) revealed pollution of Zn and
   Ni based on total metal analysis. The Pollution Load Index (PLI >1)
   supported anthropogenic origin of metals in estuary. Metal speciation
   study indicated bioavailability of metals in sediments. The bioavailable
   Mn and Co equalled/exceeded the Apparent Effect Threshold (AET) limit
   (cores K-1, K-3 and K-4) and indicated toxicity to estuarine biota. The
   metals in Metetrix casta (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and Ni), Saccostrea cucullata
   (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Co and Ni) and Villorita cyprinoides (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu,
   Co and Ni) exceeded the permissible bioaccumulation limit. Thus,
   revealed metal toxicity to bivalves and labelled them un-safe for human
   consumption. Translocation Factor (TF > 1) indicated the use of Kandelia
   candel in phyto-remediation of Fe, Zn, Cu, Co and Ni at station K-3, and
   Sonnaretia caseoloris in phyto-remediation of Fe, Zn and Ni at station
   K-4.},

Title = {Metal accumulation and biochemical variations in the freshwater mussels

Abstract = {In this study, we aimed to determine the toxic effects of metals on
   mussels (Unio mancus) selected as biomonitor organisms in the Ataturk
   Dam Lake. The effect of metal pollution was evaluated using some
   biochemical markers {[}glutathione-S-transferase (GST),
   acetylcolinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase (CaE), glutathione
   reductase (GR), metallothionein (MT)] in the digestive gland of the
   mussels. Mussels were collected from four sampling sites of dam lake in
   the winter and summer of 2016. The metal levels in the mussel samples
   varied significantly across the sites and seasons (p < 0.05). Fe was the
   most accumulated metal, followed by Zn, Cu, and As, while Hg was the
   least accumulated metal. There were significant differences among sites
   and between seasons for enzyme activities and MT levels (p < 0.05).
   Although AChE was inhibited in summer at all sites, the lowest level of
   AChE was determined for the Sitilce site. Our results showed that there
   were statistical differences for CaE, GR, and GST activities among sites
   and between seasons. MT levels were statistically higher in summer than
   in winter at all sites (p < 0.05). The highest MT level was detected at
   the Sarisu site in summer, while the lowest MT level was detected at
   Sitilce in winter. According to the results of correlation analysis, we
   observed strong correlations between MT and some metal concentrations in
   both winter and summer (p < 0.05). Our data suggest that industrial
   activities and domestic wastes along the coast of Ataturk Dam Lake are
   the main sources of metal pollutants at these sites.},

Title = {Spatial and temporal variations of trace metal body burdens of live
   mussels <i>Mytilus galloprovincialis</i> and field validation of the
   Artificial Mussels in Australian inshore marine environment},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The body burdens of eight trace metals: Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, Cr, Se, Hg, and
   As, were measured in live mussels (LMs) Mytilus galloprovincialis at 14
   coastal sites in Port Phillip Bay, Victoria, Australia in winter and
   summer between 2017 and 2018. The spatial and temporal variations of
   body burdens were evaluated. The results revealed significantly higher
   body burdens of Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, Cr, and Hg in summer at the sites where
   the city centre and industries are located. Elevated levels of most
   trace metals including 3 toxic, non-essential metals (Cd, Pb, and Hg)
   were detected in LMs from the site of Geelong. The body burdens of Zn,
   Cr, Se, and As appeared higher at the sites from the Bellarine Peninsula
   and the mouth of Port Phillip Bay.
   Besides, the ``Artificial Mussels{''} (AMs) were deployed at the same
   sites in summer for 28 d and retrieved when the LMs were collected. The
   accumulations of the eight metals were compared between AMs and LMs
   summer results. It indicated significant correlations for Pb, Cu, and
   Cr, lower correlations in Zn and Hg, and irregular correlations for Se
   and As. The AM results of Cd were below the detection limit of the
   analytical method. This study demonstrates that AMs are excellent
   replacement of LMs for the biomonitoring of multiple kinds of trace
   metals. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Metal loadings in estuarine bivalve and gastropod shellfish in response
   to socioeconomic development in watershed},
Journal = {MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {176},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Metal contamination in estuary was monitored globally using shellfish
   while estuarine metal loadings were influenced by socioeconomic
   development in watershed, i.e., a watershed-estuary chain effect.
   Socioeconomic pattern of metal loadings in estuarine shellfish has
   scarcely been studied. Eight metals and metalloids (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg,
   Ni, Pb, and Zn) highly associated with anthropogenic activities were
   quantified in tissue and shell of bivalves and gastropods (two
   feeding-habits) among 7 estuaries along the Southeastern China coast in
   the period 2016-2019. Results indicated that Cu and Zn in shellfish had
   the greatest loadings at 1,663 and 6,828 mg kg(-1)\& nbsp;dry mass in
   tissue and 387 and 151 mg kg(-1) dry mass in shell, respectively, in the
   most developed Estuary Yong. Metal loadings in tissue and shell of
   bivalves (6 common species) and gastropods (3 common species) in the
   estuaries were highly associated with urbanization and socioeconomic
   indicators in their watersheds. The socioeconomic patterns had evident
   shellfish class-specification and metal-dependency due to the
   feeding-habit. The class-specification was confirmed by the
   fractionation of stable isotope compositions for the socioeconomic
   pattern of Pb loadings in both tissue and shell. In short, both
   shellfish class-specification and metal dependency hinted that
   multi-bioindicators might be required for a comprehensive understanding
   of the estuarine environment quality, in particular at two dimensions of
   water and sediment.},

Abstract = {Freshwater mussels and crayfish are commonly used as biomonitors of
   trace metals. In the present study, the concentrations of ten metals
   were determined in mussels (Unio elongatulus eucirrus) and crayfish
   (Astacus leptodactylus) collected from the Keban Dam Reservoir in
   Turkey. The significant spatial differences in concentrations of studied
   metals except As in mussels were not found. However, Co, Cr, Cu, and Zn
   concentrations in mussels and As, Co, Cu, Fe, Pb, and Zn concentrations
   in crayfish showed significant seasonal differences. As, Cd, and Mn
   levels in mussels were about nine times higher than those in crayfish.
   The concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn, and inorganic As in crayfish
   and mussels were lower than maximum permissible levels. When compared
   with other biomonitoring studies using mussels and crayfish, high
   concentrations of As, Cd, Co, Cr, and Ni in mussels and Cr and Ni in
   crayfish were observed due to lithogenic sources and anthropogenic
   activities in the basin. Bioconcentration factor values of Fe, Mn, Cd,
   and Zn in mussels and Zn, Cu, Fe, and Co in crayfish were > 1000, which
   indicates that both U. e. eucirrus and A. leptodactylus have potential
   to bioaccumulate these metals. Therefore, attention should be paid to
   mussels and crayfish from ecological and human health perspective,
   because they are potential vectors of metals to higher trophic levels.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate bioaccumulation of nickel
   (Ni) and vanadium (V) in clams living in different salinity regimes
   along the Saudi coast of the Arabian Gulf. Several hundred clam
   (Meretrix meretrix), sediment, and seawater samples were collected from
   12 locations. Concentrations of Ni and V were determined in these
   samples using an inductively coupled argon plasma analyzer.
   Concentrations of Ni and V in the clams varied between 0.35 and 2.61 mg
   kg-1 and between 0.13 and 0.35 mg kg-1 wet tissue, respectively.
   Analysis of variance of the data revealed significant (P < 0.01) inter-
   and intra-station variations in Ni concentrations in clams. In contrast,
   the mean concentration of V in clams from all the stations were
   statistically similar. Correlation between the biometric characteristics
   of clams and Ni and V concentrations were not statistically significant.
   Significant (P < 0.05) geographical variations in Ni and V
   concentrations in the sediment samples were found, with relatively
   higher concentrations in the northern part of the Gulf where there are
   many oil fields. Ni and V in the sediments were significantly (P < 0.05)
   correlated, suggesting a common contamination source for these elements.
   Interactions between Ni and V in clams and sediment were poor.},

Title = {Biomonitoring of Trace Metals (Fe, Cu, and Ni) in the Mangrove Area of
   Peninsular Malaysia Using Different Soft Tissues of Flat Tree Oyster

Abstract = {It is well documented that marine oysters are net bioaccumulators of
   trace metals and they can be employed as biomonitors of time-integrated
   measurements of bioavailable metal fractions over their lifetime. In
   this study, the Malaysian mangrove flat tree oyster Isognomon alatus
   collected from the estuaries of Lukut River (five sites), Sepang Besar
   River (one site), and one metal-polluted site at Kg. Pasir Puteh were
   dissected into muscle, mantle plus gills, byssus, and remaining soft
   tissues. All the four different soft tissues were analyzed for Fe, Cu,
   and Ni. Significant spatial differences in the accumulated metal
   concentrations of the oysters were found between sampling sites, and
   these could be attributed to anthropogenic inputs including discharges
   of shrimp ponds (Lukut), animal husbandry (Sepang Besar), sewage,
   shipping, and industrial effluents (Kg. Pasir Puteh). For Fe, the tissue
   distribution followed: byssus > mantle plus gill > muscle > remaining
   soft tissues, while for Cu and Ni, both followed byssus > remaining soft
   tissues > mantle plus gill > muscle. This indicated that byssus could
   act as an excretion route for the metals. Based on a correlation
   analysis between oyster tissues and sediments, selected tissues of I.
   alatus were shown to be good biomonitors of Ni and Cu contamination,
   while high regulative capacity of Fe in the oyster tissues could hardly
   reflect the actual Fe levels in the surroundings. However, the
   clustering patterns based on metal levels in the four different soft
   tissues were not in agreement with those based on the geochemical
   fractions of sediment data. This phenomenon which was due to the metal
   contamination might not necessarily create high bioavailabilities of
   metals to the biomonitor I. alatus, which might involve differences in
   uptake, excretion, and sequestration of metals. Similarly to the Mussel
   Watch approach, this study points to the very potential use of the
   different soft tissues of I. alatus as biomonitors for regular
   biomonitoring in the mangrove area of Peninsular Malaysia.},

Abstract = {The uptake of Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb in soft tissue of Perna
   perna mussels and their shells has been studied in aquarium experiments
   in which mussels were exposed for 30 or 60 days to seawater spiked with
   different concentrations of these contaminants (125 and 500 mu g L-1).
   Tissue samples were analyzed after acid digestion by conventional
   solution nebulization ICP-MS. Laser ablation ICP-MS was used for the
   quantitative determination of trace elements in different areas of the
   corresponding shells. With the exception of Mn and Zn, all other
   elements studied showed a significant concentration enhancements in soft
   tissue, with the magnitude of this enhancement following the order: Cr >
   Ni > Cd > Cu > Pb. A corresponding increase in most contaminants,
   although less pronounced, was also observed in the newly formed growth
   rings of mussel shells, contributing to the validation of Perna perna
   mussel shell as a bioindicator of toxic elements.},

Title = {Assessment of metal contamination, bioavailability, toxicity and

Abstract = {The Iberian Pyrite Belt (SW Iberian Peninsula) has intense mining
   activity. Currently, its fluvial networks receive extremely acid
   lixiviate residue discharges that are rich in sulphates and metals in
   solution (acid mine drainage, AMD) from abandoned mines. In the current
   study, the sediment and water quality were analysed in three different
   areas of the Odiel River to assess the risk associated with the metal
   content and its speciation and bioavailability. Furthermore, sediment
   contact bioassays were performed using the freshwater clam Corbicula
   fluminea to determine its adequacy as a biomonitoring tool in relation
   to theoretical risk indexes and regulatory thresholds. Reburial activity
   and mortality were used as the toxic responses of clams when exposed to
   contaminated sediment.
   The results showed coherence between the water and sediment chemical
   contamination for most of the metals. The reburial activity was
   correlated with the metal toxicity, but no clam mortality was
   registered. The bioaccumulation of the studied metals in the clam did
   not have a significant correlation with the bioavailable fraction of the
   metal content in the environment, which could be related to a potential
   different speciation in this singular environment. The bioaccumulation
   responses were negative for As, Cd and Zn in highly contaminated
   environments and were characterized as severe, considerable and low
   potential environmental risks, respectively. The results show that C.
   fluminea is a good biomonitor of Cu and Pb. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Urbanization in recent years has driven us to investigate metal
   contamination on Nellore coast by collecting seawater, sediment, and
   bivalve samples monthly at five stations from 2015 to 2017. Non-metric
   multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis indicated that open sea
   (OS) samples were markedly different from the samples collected at other
   stations. Strong factor loadings of Al (0.76), Mn (0.79), and Cd (0.78)
   showed variability in seawater, while those for Fe (0.76), Ni (0.77), Zn
   (0.85), and Pb (0.81) showed variability in sediment. The mean values of
   Fe (346 ppm) and Mn (21 ppm) were high in bivalves compared to the mean
   values of other metals. A higher contamination factor was observed for
   Cd at Buckingham Canal, while the lowest was observed for sediment in
   OS. The order of trace metals in sediments according to risk index was
   Cd > Pb > Cu > Cr > Zn. The results obtained are essential to establish
   a reference for better comparison of tropical environments.},

Abstract = {The concentration assessment of Hg, Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn, Cr, Mn and Fe in
   marine mussels Perna perna, sampled at 15 stations along the 800 km
   Southern Brazilian Coast, has been carried out. Samplings were taken
   twice, in summer and winter of 2000. The concentrations found were lower
   than similar studies carried out along the Central Coast of Brazil and
   lower than the maximum limits permitted in bivalve molluscs designated
   for human consumption ( Brazilian, Spanish and Luxembourg legislation
   sets). The data also showed lower values compared with other regions of
   the world. The comparison of present data with the data obtained 10

Abstract = {The aim of the present work is to broaden our knowledge on the
   variability of metals and metalloid concentration levels in surface
   sediments, macroalgae and mollusc. Accordingly, As, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo,
   Ni, Pb, and Zn levels in surface sediments, marine macroalgae species
   (Ulva intestinalis and Ceramium rubrum) and mollusk (mussel Mytilus
   galloprovincialis) collected from nine stations along the Surmene Bay,
   Black Sea, Turkey, have been investigated using Inductively Coupled
   Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Hence, higher concentration levels of
   As, Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn have been recorded in the sediments and macroalgae
   collected from the harbor area, largely exceeding those recorded in
   previous studies carried out in the Turkish Black Sea. Consequently,
   sampled sediments from such area have revealed the highest Contamination
   Factor (Cf) values as well as the highest Contamination Degree (CD)
   levels, signaling higher ecological risks. Furthermore, U. intestinalis
   has shown higher accumulation capacity than C. rubrum and M.
   galloprovincialis. The Target Hazard Quotient (THQ) and the Hazard Index
   (HI) have been carried out in order to evaluate the non-carcinogenic
   health risks posed by metals/metalloid via M. galloprovincialis
   consumption, revealing values below 1 for all sampling sites, indicating
   thus no adverse effects on human health.},

Abstract = {This study quantified and evaluated the concentrations of trace elements
   Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn in mussels Perna perna collected
   in Urubuquecaba island, Santos Bay, S (a) over tildeo Paulo, Brazil.
   This region presents port and industrial activities, as well as high
   population densification. The collections in natural mussel beds
   occurred in eight campaigns, two per season of the year, totaling 240
   samples, from April 2010 to June 2011. The determination of the
   concentration of trace elements was performed using the Atomic
   Absorption Spectrometer (AAS) Flame. The statistical analysis used the
   PAST Software 1 using p <0.05 as significant. Average concentrations in
   mu g g(-1) wet weight obeyed the order Cd (0.11), Cr (0.37), Pb (0.38),
   Cu (1.63), Ni (2.31), Mn (2.33), Zn (27.11), Fe (179.97) and Al
   (375.23). The results were compared with other studies of mussels and
   Brazilian standards that establish maximum allowable concentrations for
   human consumption, only Cr showed concentrations above those permitted
   by Brazilian standards.},

Abstract = {Surface sediment samples from 10 coastal locations were analyzed with
   respect to their physical and chemical characteristics as well as their
   biological quality. The toxicity of the decanted fresh and freeze-dried
   sediments and of their elutriates was assessed by bioassays with embryos
   of the oysters Crassostrea gigas. The concentration inhibiting normal
   embryogenesis in 20\% of the larvae (EC20) was used as a measure of
   toxicity and compared with the physical and chemical properties of the
   sediments and elutriates by principal components analysis. Decanted
   whole sediments were one to four orders of magnitude more toxic than
   their elutriates because the latter have lower contaminant
   concentrations. The biological effects of decanted whole sediment
   depended mostly on the levels of heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs), while in the case of the elutriates, the toxicity
   was mainly correlated with the concentrations of total ammonia and of
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Freeze-dried sediments and their
   elutriates were up to one order of magnitude more toxic than fresh
   sediments and elutriates, respectively, presumably because the
   freeze-drying procedure increases pollutant bioavailability or causes a
   release of unidentified organic compounds having toxic effects.},

   this unique ecosystem. Trace metal (Pb, Hg, Ni, Co and Cd)
   concentrations were measured in the winter, spring and fall of 2008 in
   two marine organisms (Posidonia oceanica and Mytilus galloprovincialis)
   selected as biomonitors of trace metals in the Boka Kotorska Bay. These
   marine organisms have the ability to accumulate trace metals from their
   environment. Metal pollution indexes (MPI) for both species were
   compared, confirming that the most polluted was Tivat bay and the least

Title = {Establishing baseline trace metals in marine bivalves in China and
   worldwide: Meta-analysis and modeling approach},

Abstract = {Bivalves are extensively employed as biomonitors of coastal pollution,
   but the comparability among different species and geographic
   environments needs to be further scrutinized. The present study
   conducted a meta-analysis of trace metals (Ag, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Ti,
   and Zn) in the soft tissues of three groups of marine bivalves (oysters,
   mussels, and clams) collected from China and worldwide. By conducting
   cumulative frequency distribution analysis of metal distribution, we
   modeled the 5\% cumulative values as the bio-baseline metal
   concentrations in these bivalves. We further modeled their potential
   baseline concentrations using a well-developed biokinetic model. The
   baseline concentrations of Cd, Cu, and Zn in the tissue-specific
   Environmental Quality Standards (EQSs) for China were 0.99, 34.5, and
   340 mu g/g dw in oysters, 0.38, 4.32, and 49.6 mu g/g dw in mussels, and
   0.35, 3.02, 51.4 mu g/g dwin clams, respectively. Of the 8 metals
   examined in this study, the calculated baseline concentrations of Ag,
   Cr, Cd, Cu and Zn in the oysters were 3.7-48, 2.7-3.6, 2.6-2.8,
   8.0-11.4, 6.6-6.8 times higher than those in the mussels and clams, and
   only Ti showed comparable baseline concentrations among the three
   bivalves (8.43-9.67 mu g/g dw). These data strongly suggested the
   inter-group as well as inter-metal difference in the baseline metal
   concentrations in marine bivalves. Further, the potential baseline
   concentrations of Cd and Cu predicted by the biokinetic model were
   comparable to those modeled by the probability frequency distribution.
   Combined statistical frequency analysis and biokinetic modeling
   therefore provided an innovative method to establish the baseline metal
   concentrations in bivalves and the tissue-specific EQSs, which are now
   urgently needed for coastal management, biomonitoring, and geochemical
   records in the world. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Twelve trace elements were studied in four economically important
   bivalve molluscs (Mediterranean mussel, manila clam, striped venus clam,
   and truncated wedge clam) from the southern Marmara Sea for seasonal
   bioaccumulation and human health risk assessment. According to the
   findings, Fe and Zn were the most accumulative and element
   concentrations changed considerably (P < 0.05) between seasons and
   species. Daily, weekly, monthly intake and target hazard quotients of
   the trace elements were estimated and compared with maximum limits. The
   results revealed that consuming these bivalve molluscs from the southern
   Marmara Sea could be considered safe for human consumption.
   Nevertheless, further monitoring is needed in order to better follow the
   development in time of elemental pollution due to increasing
   environmental pressure on the Marmara Sea basin, together with research
   on other different bioaccumulative organisms.},

Abstract = {The Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum is one of the most important
   commercial bivalve species consumed in China. Evaluated metal burden in
   bivalve molluscs can pose potential risks to public health as a result
   of their frequent consumption. In this study, concentrations of 10 trace
   elements (Cu, Zn, Mn, Se, Ni, Cd, Cr, Pb, Hg and As) were determined in
   samples of the bivalve Ruditapes philippinarum, collected from nine
   mariculture zones along the coast of China between November and December
   in 2010, in order to evaluate the status of elemental metal pollution in
   these areas. Also, a public health risk assessment was untaken to assess
   the potential risks associated with the consumption of clams. The ranges
   of concentrations found for Cu, Zn, Mn, Se, Ni, Cd, Cr, Pb, Hg and As in
   R. philippinarum were 12.1-38.0, 49.5-168.3, 42.0-68.0, 4.19-8.71,
   4.76-14.32, 0.41-1.11, 0.94-4.74, 0.32-2.59, 0.03-0.23 and 0.46-11.95
   mg.kg(-1) dry weight, respectively. Clear spatial variations were found
   for Cu, Zn, Cr, Pb, Hg and As, whereas Mn, Se, Ni, and Cd did not show
   significant spatial variation. Hotspots of trace element contamination
   in R. philippinarum can be found along the coast of China, from the
   north to the south, especially in the Bohai and Yellow Seas. Based on a
   58.1 kg individual consuming 29 g of bivalve molluscs per day, the
   values of the estimated daily intake (EDI) of trace elements analyzed
   were significantly lower than the values of the accepted daily intake
   (ADI) established by Joint Food and Agriculture Organization/World
   Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives (JFAO/WHO) and
   the guidelines of the reference does (RfD) established by the United
   States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). Additionally, the risk
   of trace elements to humans through R. philippinarum consumption was
   also assessed. The calculated hazard quotients (HQ) of all trace
   elements were less than 1. Consequently, there was no obvious public
   risk from the intake of these trace elements through R. philippinarum
   consumption.},

Abstract = {Seafood is a major dietary food worldwide. However, seafood consumption
   by humans can induce health risk because seafood may be contaminated by
   various pollutants. The mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis is widely
   distributed in the coastal waters of Montenegro, SouthEast Adriatic Sea.
   Here, Zn, Fe, Cu, Ni, Cd, Pb, As, and Hg contents in M.
   galloprovincialis from ten sites were analyzed to investigate health
   risks associated with the consumption of wild and cultivated mussels.
   Since there is a lack of data on the mussel consumption rate in
   Montenegro, the amount of mussels that can be ingested weekly over a
   lifetime with no risk of negative health effects was calculated using
   provisional tolerable weekly intakes (PTWI). We found that Cd
   concentrations were the limiting factor for mussels as a food. The
   weekly consumptions of 0.64-1.2 kg of fresh wild and 0.84-1.2 kg of
   fresh cultivated mussel would be sufficient to reach the PTWICd, which
   may result in a risky weekly intake of Cd for long-term exposure.
   Moreover, weekly intake of 125 g mussels was used to calculate the
   dietary intake of trace elements by mussel consumption and compared with
   the prescribed PTWIs. Here, we found that there is no risk for human
   health for all investigated elements. In this case, the highest Cd level
   obtained in wild and in cultivated mussels represents 19.8 and 14.9\% of
   the PTWICd, respectively. This is the first study in Montenegro giving
   an assessment of the health risk from trace elements via the consumption
   of wild and cultivated M. galloprovincialis.},

Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {178},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {As coastal ecosystems are impacted by land use change and anthropogenic
   activities, oysters can be an important tool for monitoring local water
   quality. We collected oysters (Crassostrea rhizophorae and Isognomon
   alatus) from coastal sites near Gu ` anica and La Parguera in southwest
   Puerto Rico and analyzed their tissue for concentrations of Ag, As, Cd,
   Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn. All trace metals were found in both
   species, with high bioaccumulation factors for Ag, Cd, and Zn in both
   species and Cr in C. rhizophorae. Some trace metals are likely
   associated with anthropogenic sources, including paints and vehicles (Cu
   and Zn), oil (Ni and V), and wood preservatives (As). Cr in oysters near
   Gu ` anica is most likely associated with sediment from erosion in the
   watershed. Both species could be used to monitor changes in trace metal
   concentrations and the influence of future watershed management
   strategies in the region.},

Abstract = {Metal contamination is a threat to estuarine environments. They can
   accumulate in the food chain and cause toxic effects on aquatic
   organisms and human health. This study evaluated the concentrations of
   metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in aquatic organisms of Antonina
   Bay (southern Brazil) to analyze whether the metal concentrations were
   in accordance with Brazilian food legislation and estimate the human
   risk of local seafood consumption. All analyzed organisms (Centropomus
   parallelus,Mugil curema,Genidens genidens,Crassostrea brasiliana,
   andXiphopenaeus kroyeri) showed traces of metals in their tissues with
   different metal concentrations among species. Metal concentrations were
   generally higher in oysterC. brasiliana, and biomagnification was not
   observed. Cr and Zn concentrations were above the limits established by
   legislation for all species in at least one sample. The concentrations
   of the other metals were within permitted levels. However,
   concentrations of Cd, Cr, Fe, and Zn posed a human consumption risk. In
   general, theC. brasilianaoyster presented the highest risk for human
   consumption, probably due to its filtering habit. Thus, the results
   indicated that metal concentrations in the tissues of the Antonina Bay
   seafood can pose a risk to human health, and this chronic exposure to
   metals also can cause toxic effects on local aquatic biota.},

Abstract = {The concentration of nine trace elements were analyzed in the different
   tissue organs of commonly available crabs (Portunus sanguinolentus,
   Portunus pelagicus and Scylla serrate) and bivalve (Polymesoda erosa)
   species collected from the Miri coast, Borneo in order to evaluate the
   potential health risk by consumption of these aquatic organisms. Among
   the analyzed organs, metal accumulation was higher in the gill tissues.
   The essential (Cu and Zn) and non-essential (Pb and Cd) elements showed
   the highest (i.e. Zn) and lowest concentrations (i.e. Cd) in their
   tissue organs, respectively. The estimated daily intake and hazard
   indices of all metals in the muscle indicate that the measured values
   were below the provisional tolerable daily intake suggested by the joint
   FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives. Compared to Malaysian and
   international seafood guideline values the results obtained from the
   present study are lower than the permissible limits and safe for
   consumption.},

Abstract = {The ubiquitous presence of microplastics (MPs) and trace elements in the
   marine environment is regarded as a global threat to marine organisms.
   The current study aims to assess MP levels and trace element (Cu, Zn,
   Cd, Pb, Se, and Fe) accumulation in the shellfish Arca noae collected
   from five locations along the southeastern Mediterranean coasts,
   Alexandria, Egypt. The frequency of the occurrence of ingested MPs in A.
   noae soft tissues was 48\%, whereas the abundance of MPs was 1.65 +/-
   0.28 MP/individual and 0.58 +/- 0.04 items g(1) of the wet weight of
   tissue. Polyethylene was the most abundant polymer in A. noae, followed
   by polypropylene and polystyrene. The concentration levels of Zn, Cd,
   and Pb detected in the soft tissues of A. noae are higher than the
   maximum permissible limits. This study provides baseline data for
   further environmental assessments, with the use of A. noae as an early

Title = {MINOR AND TRACE-ELEMENTS IN THE SHELL OF PATELLA-VULGATA (L)},
Journal = {MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {55-76},
Abstract = {Specimens of the common limpet (Patella vulgata) were collected from
   each of three sites of high chemical characterisation around the coast
   of Anglesey, North Wales, UK. The shells were analysed individually for
   their minor element (Mg, Sr) and trace element (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn) content.
   Mean concentrations (n = 75) of these elements in the shell of P.
   Vulgata were 3621, 1566, 15.6, 46.1, 2.7 and 3.9 mu g g(-1),
   respectively. The elemental concentrations, however, exhibited both a
   marked intra-and inter-population variability. Principal component
   analysis applied to the data for individual populations showed the
   element concentrations in the shell to be controlled by three
   contemporaneous, but quite different agencies. Despite the variability
   within individual populations, significant differences in gross element
   composition were apparent amongst the three populations studied. The
   environmental availability of elements at the three sites was not
   reflected in the trace metal concentrations of the shells. The shell of
   P. Vulgata is therefore rejected for potential use in environmental
   trace metal monitoring.},
